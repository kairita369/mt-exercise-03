What does my hair matter !
Bother my hair !
That ’ s what I say !
Indeed it will be better if she does begin pulling it , that ’ s not what I am afraid of ... it ’ s her eyes I am afraid of ... yes , her eyes ... the red on her cheeks , too , frightens me ... and her breathing too .... Have you noticed how people in that disease breathe ... when they are excited ?
I am frightened of the children ’ s crying , too .... For if Sonia has not taken them food ...
I don ’ t know what ’ s happened !
I don ’ t know !
But blows I am not afraid of .... Know , sir , that such blows are not a pain to me , but even an enjoyment .
In fact I can ’ t get on without it .... It ’ s better so .
Let her strike me , it <unk> her heart ... it ’ s better so ...
There is the house .
The house of Kozel , the <unk> ... a German , well-to-do .
Lead the way ! ” They went in from the yard and up to the fourth storey .
The staircase got darker and darker as they went up .
It was nearly eleven o ’ clock and although in summer in Petersburg there is no real night , yet it was quite dark at the top of the stairs .
A grimy little door at the very top of the stairs stood ajar .
A very <unk> room about ten paces long was lighted up by a candle-end ; the whole of it was <unk> from the entrance .
It was all in disorder , <unk> up with rags of all sorts , especially children ’ s garments .
<unk> the furthest corner was stretched a ragged sheet .
Behind it probably was the bed .
There was nothing in the room except two chairs and a sofa covered with American leather , full of holes , before which stood an old deal <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
At the edge of the table stood a <unk> <unk> in an iron candlestick .
It appeared that the family had a room to themselves , not part of a room , but their room was practically a passage .
The door leading to the other rooms , or rather <unk> , into which Amalia Lippevechsel ’ s flat was divided stood half open , and there was shouting , uproar and laughter within .
People seemed to be playing cards and drinking tea there .
<unk> of the most <unk> kind flew out from time to time .
Raskolnikov recognised Katerina Ivanovna at once .
She was a rather tall , slim and graceful woman , terribly emaciated , with magnificent dark brown hair and with a hectic flush in her cheeks .
She was pacing up and down in her little room , pressing her hands against her chest ; her lips were parched and her breathing came in nervous broken <unk> .
Her eyes glittered as in fever and looked about with a harsh immovable stare .
And that consumptive and excited face with the last flickering light of the candle-end playing upon it made a sickening impression .
She seemed to Raskolnikov about thirty years old and was certainly a strange wife for Marmeladov .... She had not heard them and did not notice them coming in .
She seemed to be lost in thought , hearing and seeing nothing .
The room was close , but she had not opened the window ; a stench rose from the staircase , but the door on to the stairs was not closed .
From the inner rooms clouds of tobacco smoke floated in , she kept coughing , but did not close the door .
The youngest child , a girl of six , was asleep , sitting curled up on the floor with her head on the sofa .
A boy a year older stood crying and shaking in the corner , probably he had just had a beating .
<unk> him stood a girl of nine years old , tall and thin , wearing a thin and ragged chemise with an ancient <unk> <unk> flung over her bare shoulders , long <unk> and <unk> reaching her knees .
Her arm , as thin as a stick , was round her brother ’ s neck .
She was trying to comfort him , whispering something to him , and doing all she could to keep him from whimpering again .
At the same time her large dark eyes , which looked larger still from the <unk> of her frightened face , were watching her mother with alarm .
Marmeladov did not enter the door , but dropped on his knees in the very doorway , pushing Raskolnikov in front of him .
The woman seeing a stranger stopped indifferently facing him , coming to herself for a moment and apparently wondering what he had come for .
But evidently she decided that he was going into the next room , as he had to pass through hers to get there .
Taking no further notice of him , she walked towards the outer door to close it and uttered a sudden scream on seeing her husband on his knees in the doorway .
“ Ah ! ” she cried out in a frenzy , “ he has come back !
The criminal !
the monster ! ...
And where is the money ?
What ’ s in your pocket , show me !
And your clothes are all different !
Where are your clothes ?
Where is the money !
Speak ! ” And she fell to searching him .
Marmeladov <unk> and <unk> held up both arms to <unk> the search .
Not a farthing was there .
“ Where is the money ? ” she <unk> “ Mercy on us , can he have drunk it all ?
There were twelve silver roubles left in the chest ! ” and in a fury she seized him by the hair and dragged him into the room .
Marmeladov <unk> her efforts by meekly <unk> along on his knees .
“ And this is a consolation to me !
This does not hurt me , but is a positive <unk> , <unk> sir , ” he called out , shaken to and fro by his hair and even once striking the ground with his forehead .
The child asleep on the floor woke up , and began to cry .
The boy in the corner losing all control began trembling and screaming and rushed to his sister in violent terror , almost in a fit .
The eldest girl was shaking like a leaf .
“ He ’ s drunk it !
he ’ s drunk it all , ” the poor woman screamed in <unk> “ and his clothes are gone !
And they are hungry , hungry ! ” --and wringing her hands she pointed to the children .
“ Oh , accursed life !
And you , are you not ashamed ? ” --she pounced all at once upon Raskolnikov-- “ from the tavern !
Have you been drinking with him ?
You have been drinking with him , too !
Go away ! ” The young man was hastening away without uttering a word .
The inner door was thrown wide open and inquisitive faces were <unk> in at it .
<unk> laughing faces with pipes and cigarettes and heads wearing caps thrust themselves in at the doorway .
<unk> in could be seen figures in dressing <unk> flung open , in <unk> of unseemly <unk> , some of them with cards in their hands .
They were particularly diverted , when Marmeladov , dragged about by his hair , shouted that it was a consolation to him .
They even began to come into the room ; at last a sinister shrill outcry was heard : this came from Amalia Lippevechsel herself pushing her way amongst them and trying to restore order after her own fashion and for the hundredth time to frighten the poor woman by <unk> her with coarse abuse to clear out of the room next day .
As he went out , Raskolnikov had time to put his hand into his pocket , to snatch up the coppers he had received in exchange for his rouble in the tavern and to lay them unnoticed on the window .
Afterwards on the stairs , he changed his mind and would have gone back .
“ What a stupid thing I ’ ve done , ” he thought to himself , “ they have Sonia and I want it myself . ” But reflecting that it would be impossible to take it back now and that in any case he would not have taken it , he dismissed it with a wave of his hand and went back to his lodging .
“ Sonia wants pomatum too , ” he said as he walked along the street , and he laughed <unk> “ such smartness costs money .... Hm !
And maybe Sonia herself will be <unk> to-day , for there is always a risk , hunting big game ... <unk> for gold ... then they would all be without a crust to-morrow except for my money .
Hurrah for Sonia !
What a mine they ’ ve <unk> there !
And they ’ re making the most of it !
Yes , they are making the most of it !
They ’ ve wept over it and grown used to it .
Man <unk> used to everything , the scoundrel ! ” He sank into thought .
“ And what if I am wrong , ” he cried suddenly after a moment ’ s thought .
“ What if man is not really a scoundrel , man in general , I mean , the whole race of <unk> all the rest is prejudice , simply artificial terrors and there are no barriers and it ’ s all as it should be . ” CHAPTER III He waked up late next day after a broken sleep .
But his sleep had not <unk> him ; he waked up <unk> , irritable , <unk> , and looked with hatred at his room .
It was a tiny cupboard of a room about six paces in length .
It had a poverty-stricken appearance with its dusty yellow paper <unk> off the walls , and it was so low-pitched that a man of more than average height was ill at ease in it and felt every moment that he would knock his head against the ceiling .
The furniture was in keeping with the room : there were three old chairs , rather <unk> ; a painted table in the corner on which lay a few <unk> and books ; the dust that lay thick upon them showed that they had been long untouched .
A big clumsy sofa occupied almost the whole of one wall and half the floor space of the room ; it was once covered with <unk> , but was now in rags and served Raskolnikov as a bed .
<unk> he went to sleep on it , as he was , without undressing , without sheets , wrapped in his old student ’ s overcoat , with his head on one little pillow , under which he <unk> up all the linen he had , clean and dirty , by way of a <unk> .
A little table stood in front of the sofa .
It would have been difficult to sink to a lower <unk> of disorder , but to Raskolnikov in his present state of mind this was positively agreeable .
He had got completely away from everyone , like a <unk> in its shell , and even the sight of a servant girl who had to wait upon him and looked sometimes into his room made him <unk> with nervous irritation .
He was in the condition that <unk> some monomaniacs entirely concentrated upon one thing .
His landlady had for the last fortnight given up sending him in <unk> , and he had not yet thought of <unk> with her , though he went without his dinner .
Nastasya , the cook and only servant , was rather pleased at the lodger ’ s mood and had entirely given up sweeping and doing his room , only once a week or so she would <unk> into his room with a broom .
She waked him up that day .
“ Get up , why are you asleep ? ” she called to him .
“ It ’ s past nine , I have brought you some tea ; will you have a cup ?
I should think you ’ re fairly starving ? ” Raskolnikov opened his eyes , started and recognised Nastasya .
“ From the landlady , eh ? ” he asked , slowly and with a sickly face sitting up on the sofa .
“ From the landlady , indeed ! ” She set before him her own cracked <unk> full of weak and stale tea and laid two yellow <unk> of sugar by the side of it .
“ Here , Nastasya , take it please , ” he said , fumbling in his pocket ( for he had slept in his clothes ) and taking out a <unk> of <unk> “ run and buy me a loaf .
And get me a little sausage , the cheapest , at the <unk> ’ s . ” “ The loaf I ’ ll fetch you this very minute , but wouldn ’ t you rather have some cabbage soup instead of sausage ?
It ’ s capital soup , yesterday ’ s .
I saved it for you yesterday , but you came in late .
It ’ s fine soup . ” When the soup had been brought , and he had begun upon it , Nastasya sat down beside him on the sofa and began <unk> .
She was a country <unk> and a very talkative one .
“ Praskovya Pavlovna means to complain to the police about you , ” she said .
He scowled .
“ To the police ?
What does she want ? ” “ You don ’ t pay her money and you won ’ t turn out of the room .
That ’ s what she wants , to be sure . ” “ The devil , that ’ s the last straw , ” he muttered , grinding his teeth , “ no , that would not suit me ... just now .
She is a fool , ” he added aloud .
“ I ’ ll go and talk to her to-day . ” “ Fool she is and no mistake , just as I am .
But why , if you are so clever , do you lie here like a sack and have nothing to show for it ?
One time you used to go out , you say , to teach children .
But why is it you do nothing now ? ” “ I am doing ... ” Raskolnikov began sullenly and reluctantly .
“ What are you doing ? ” “ <unk> ... ” “ What sort of work ? ” “ I am thinking , ” he answered seriously after a pause .
Nastasya was overcome with a fit of laughter .
She was given to laughter and when anything amused her , she laughed <unk> , quivering and shaking all over till she felt ill . “ And have you made much money by your thinking ? ” she managed to articulate at last .
“ One can ’ t go out to give lessons without boots .
And I ’ m sick of it . ” “ Don ’ t quarrel with your bread and <unk> . ” “ They pay so little for lessons .
What ’ s the use of a few coppers ? ” he answered , reluctantly , as though replying to his own thought .
“ And you want to get a fortune all at once ? ” He looked at her strangely .
“ Yes , I want a fortune , ” he answered firmly , after a brief pause .
“ Don ’ t be in such a hurry , you quite frighten me !
Shall I get you the loaf or not ? ” “ As you please . ” “ Ah , I forgot !
A letter came for you yesterday when you were out . ” “ A letter ?
for me !
from whom ? ” “ I can ’ t say .
I gave three copecks of my own to the <unk> for it .
Will you pay me back ? ” “ Then bring it to me , for God ’ s sake , bring it , ” cried Raskolnikov greatly <unk> “ good God ! ” A minute later the letter was brought him .
That was it : from his mother , from the province of <unk> .
He turned pale when he took it .
It was a long while since he had received a letter , but another feeling also suddenly stabbed his heart .
“ Nastasya , leave me alone , for goodness ’ sake ; here are your three copecks , but for goodness ’ sake , make haste and go ! ” The letter was quivering in his hand ; he did not want to open it in her presence ; he wanted to be left _ alone _ with this letter .
When Nastasya had gone out , he lifted it quickly to his lips and kissed it ; then he gazed intently at the address , the small , sloping handwriting , so dear and familiar , of the mother who had once taught him to read and write .
He delayed ; he seemed almost afraid of something .
At last he opened it ; it was a thick heavy letter , weighing over two <unk> , two large sheets of note paper were covered with very small handwriting .
“ My dear Rodya , ” wrote his <unk> “ it ’ s two months since I last had a talk with you by letter which has distressed me and even kept me awake at night , thinking .
But I am sure you will not blame me for my inevitable silence .
You know how I love you ; you are all we have to look to , Dounia and I , you are our all , our one hope , our one stay .
What a grief it was to me when I heard that you had given up the university some months ago , for want of means to keep yourself and that you had lost your lessons and your other work !
How could I help you out of my hundred and twenty roubles a year pension ?
The fifteen roubles I sent you four months ago I <unk> , as you know , on security of my pension , from <unk> Ivanovitch Vahrushin a merchant of this town .
He is a kind-hearted man and was a friend of your father ’ s too .
But having given him the right to receive the pension , I had to wait till the debt was paid off and that is only just done , so that I ’ ve been unable to send you anything all this time .
But now , thank God , I believe I shall be able to send you something more and in fact we may congratulate ourselves on our good fortune now , of which I hasten to inform you .
In the first place , would you have guessed , dear Rodya , that your sister has been living with me for the last six weeks and we shall not be separated in the future .
Thank God , her sufferings are over , but I will tell you everything in order , so that you may know just how everything has happened and all that we have hitherto concealed from you .
When you wrote to me two months ago that you had heard that Dounia had a great deal to put up with in the Svidrigaïlovs ’ house , when you wrote that and asked me to tell you all about it--what could I write in answer to you ?
If I had written the whole truth to you , I dare say you would have thrown up everything and have come to us , even if you had to walk all the way , for I know your character and your feelings , and you would not let your sister be insulted .
I was in despair myself , but what could I do ?
And , besides , I did not know the whole truth myself then .
What made it all so difficult was that Dounia received a hundred roubles in advance when she took the place as governess in their family , on condition of part of her salary being <unk> every month , and so it was impossible to throw up the situation without <unk> the debt .
This sum ( now I can explain it all to you , my precious Rodya ) she took chiefly in order to send you sixty roubles , which you needed so terribly then and which you received from us last year .
We deceived you then , writing that this money came from Dounia ’ s <unk> , but that was not so , and now I tell you all about it , because , thank God , things have suddenly changed for the better , and that you may know how Dounia loves you and what a heart she has .
At first indeed Mr. Svidrigaïlov treated her very rudely and used to make <unk> and jeering remarks at table ....
But I don ’ t want to go into all those painful details , so as not to worry you for nothing when it is now all over .
In short , in spite of the kind and generous behaviour of Marfa Petrovna , Mr. Svidrigaïlov ’ s wife , and all the rest of the <unk> , Dounia had a very hard time , especially when Mr. Svidrigaïlov , <unk> into his old <unk> habits , was under the influence of <unk> .
And how do you think it was all explained later on ?
Would you believe that the crazy fellow had conceived a passion for Dounia from the beginning , but had concealed it under a show of rudeness and contempt .
Possibly he was ashamed and <unk> himself at his own <unk> hopes , considering his years and his being the father of a family ; and that made him angry with Dounia .
And possibly , too , he hoped by his rude and sneering behaviour to hide the truth from others .
But at last he lost all control and had the face to make Dounia an open and shameful <unk> , <unk> her all sorts of <unk> and <unk> , besides , to throw up everything and take her to another estate of his , or even abroad .
You can imagine all she went through !
To leave her situation at once was impossible not only on account of the money debt , but also to spare the feelings of Marfa Petrovna , whose suspicions would have been aroused : and then Dounia would have been the cause of a rupture in the family .
And it would have meant a terrible scandal for Dounia too ; that would have been inevitable .
There were various other reasons owing to which Dounia could not hope to escape from that awful house for another six weeks .
You know Dounia , of course ; you know how clever she is and what a strong will she has .
Dounia can endure a great deal and even in the most difficult cases she has the <unk> to maintain her <unk> .
She did not even write to me about everything for fear of upsetting me , although we were constantly in <unk> .
It all ended very unexpectedly .
Marfa Petrovna accidentally <unk> her husband imploring Dounia in the garden , and , putting quite a wrong <unk> on the position , threw the blame upon her , believing her to be the cause of it all .
An awful scene took place between them on the spot in the garden ; Marfa Petrovna went so far as to strike Dounia , refused to hear anything and was shouting at her for a whole hour and then gave orders that Dounia should be <unk> off at once to me in a plain peasant ’ s cart , into which they flung all her things , her linen and her clothes , all <unk> , without <unk> it up and <unk> it .
And a heavy shower of rain came on , too , and Dounia , insulted and put to shame , had to drive with a peasant in an open cart all the seventeen versts into town .
Only think now what answer could I have sent to the letter I received from you two months ago and what could I have written ?
I was in despair ; I dared not write to you the truth because you would have been very unhappy , <unk> and indignant , and yet what could you do ?
You could only perhaps ruin yourself , and , besides , Dounia would not allow it ; and fill up my letter with trifles when my heart was so full of sorrow , I could not .
For a whole month the town was full of gossip about this scandal , and it came to such a pass that Dounia and I dared not even go to church on account of the contemptuous looks , <unk> , and even remarks made aloud about us .
All our acquaintances avoided us , nobody even bowed to us in the street , and I learnt that some <unk> and clerks were intending to insult us in a shameful way , <unk> the gates of our house with pitch , so that the <unk> began to tell us we must leave .
All this was set going by Marfa Petrovna who managed to slander Dounia and throw dirt at her in every family .
She knows everyone in the neighbourhood , and that month she was continually coming into the town , and as she is rather talkative and fond of <unk> about her family affairs and particularly of complaining to all and each of her <unk> is not at all <unk> in a short time she had spread her story not only in the town , but over the whole <unk> district .
It made me ill , but Dounia bore it better than I did , and if only you could have seen how she endured it all and tried to comfort me and <unk> me up !
She is an angel !
But by God ’ s mercy , our sufferings were cut short : Mr. Svidrigaïlov returned to his senses and <unk> and , probably feeling sorry for Dounia , he laid before Marfa Petrovna a complete and unmistakable proof of Dounia ’ s innocence , in the form of a letter Dounia had been forced to write and give to him , before Marfa Petrovna came upon them in the garden .
This letter , which remained in Mr. Svidrigaïlov ’ s hands after her departure , she had written to refuse personal explanations and secret interviews , for which he was <unk> her .
In that letter she reproached him with great heat and indignation for the <unk> of his behaviour in regard to Marfa Petrovna , <unk> him that he was the father and head of a family and telling him how infamous it was of him to <unk> and make unhappy a defenceless girl , unhappy enough already .
Indeed , dear Rodya , the letter was so <unk> and <unk> written that I sobbed when I read it and to this day I cannot read it without tears .
Moreover , the evidence of the servants , too , cleared Dounia ’ s reputation ; they had seen and known a great deal more than Mr. Svidrigaïlov had himself <unk> indeed is always the case with servants .
Marfa Petrovna was completely taken aback , and ‘ again crushed ’ as she said herself to us , but she was completely convinced of Dounia ’ s innocence .
The very next day , being Sunday , she went straight to the <unk> , knelt down and prayed with tears to Our <unk> to give her strength to bear this new trial and to do her duty .
Then she came straight from the <unk> to us , told us the whole story , wept bitterly and , fully <unk> , she embraced Dounia and <unk> her to forgive her .
The same morning without any delay , she went round to all the houses in the town and everywhere , <unk> tears , she <unk> in the most flattering terms Dounia ’ s innocence and the nobility of her feelings and her <unk> .
What was more , she showed and read to everyone the letter in Dounia ’ s own handwriting to Mr. Svidrigaïlov and even allowed them to take copies of <unk> I must say I think was <unk> .
In this way she was busy for several days in driving about the whole town , because some people had taken offence through <unk> having been given to others .
And therefore they had to take turns , so that in every house she was expected before she arrived , and everyone knew that on such and such a day Marfa Petrovna would be reading the letter in such and such a place and people <unk> for every reading of it , even many who had heard it several times already both in their own houses and in other people ’ s .
In my opinion a great deal , a very great deal of all this was unnecessary ; but that ’ s Marfa Petrovna ’ s character .
Anyway she succeeded in completely <unk> Dounia ’ s reputation and the whole <unk> of this affair rested as an <unk> disgrace upon her husband , as the only person to blame , so that I really began to feel sorry for him ; it was really treating the crazy fellow too harshly .
Dounia was at once asked to give lessons in several <unk> , but she refused .
All of a sudden everyone began to treat her with marked respect and all this did much to bring about the <unk> by which , one may say , our whole <unk> are now transformed .
You must know , dear Rodya , that Dounia has a <unk> and that she has already consented to marry him .
I hasten to tell you all about the matter , and though it has been arranged without asking your consent , I think you will not be aggrieved with me or with your sister on that account , for you will see that we could not wait and put off our decision till we heard from you .
And you could not have <unk> all the facts without being on the spot .
This was how it happened .
He is already of the rank of a counsellor , Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin , and is <unk> <unk> to Marfa Petrovna , who has been very active in bringing the match about .
It began with his expressing through her his desire to make our acquaintance .
He was properly received , drank coffee with us and the very next day he sent us a letter in which he very <unk> made an offer and begged for a <unk> and decided answer .
He is a very busy man and is in a great hurry to get to Petersburg , so that every moment is precious to him .
At first , of course , we were greatly surprised , as it had all happened so quickly and unexpectedly .
We thought and talked it over the whole day .
He is a well-to-do man , to be depended upon , he has two <unk> in the government and has already made his fortune .
It is true that he is <unk> years old , but he is of a fairly prepossessing appearance and might still be thought attractive by women , and he is altogether a very respectable and <unk> man , only he seems a little morose and somewhat conceited .
But possibly that may only be the impression he makes at first sight .
And <unk> , dear Rodya , when he comes to Petersburg , as he shortly will do , <unk> of judging him too hastily and severely , as your way is , if there is anything you do not like in him at first sight .
I give you this <unk> , although I feel sure that he will make a favourable impression upon you .
Moreover , in order to understand any man one must be <unk> and careful to avoid forming prejudices and mistaken ideas , which are very difficult to correct and get over afterwards .
And Pyotr Petrovitch , judging by many <unk> , is a thoroughly <unk> man .
At his first visit , indeed , he told us that he was a practical man , but still he shares , as he expressed it , many of the convictions ‘ of our most rising generation ’ and he is an <unk> of all prejudices .
He said a good deal more , for he seems a little conceited and likes to be listened to , but this is scarcely a vice .
I , of course , understood very little of it , but Dounia explained to me that , though he is not a man of great education , he is clever and seems to be good-natured .
You know your sister ’ s character , Rodya .
She is a resolute , sensible , patient and generous girl , but she has a passionate heart , as I know very well .
Of course , there is no great love either on his side , or on hers , but Dounia is a clever girl and has the heart of an angel , and will make it her duty to make her husband happy who on his side will make her happiness his care .
Of that we have no good reason to doubt , though it must be admitted the matter has been arranged in great haste .
Besides he is a man of great prudence and he will see , to be sure , of himself , that his own happiness will be the more secure , the happier Dounia is with him .
And as for some <unk> of character , for some habits and even certain <unk> of <unk> indeed are inevitable even in the <unk> <unk> has said that , as regards all that , she <unk> on herself , that there is nothing to be uneasy about , and that she is ready to put up with a great deal , if only their future <unk> can be an honourable and straightforward one .
He struck me , for instance , at first , as rather <unk> , but that may well come from his being an <unk> man , and that is no doubt how it is .
For instance , at his second visit , after he had received Dounia ’ s consent , in the course of conversation , he declared that before making Dounia ’ s acquaintance , he had made up his mind to marry a girl of good reputation , without <unk> and , above all , one who had experienced poverty , because , as he explained , a man ought not to be <unk> to his wife , but that it is better for a wife to look upon her husband as her benefactor .
I must add that he expressed it more nicely and politely than I have done , for I have forgotten his actual phrases and only remember the meaning .
And , besides , it was obviously not said of design , but slipped out in the heat of conversation , so that he tried afterwards to correct himself and <unk> it over , but all the same it did strike me as somewhat rude , and I said so afterwards to Dounia .
But Dounia was vexed , and answered that ‘ words are not deeds , ’ and that , of course , is perfectly true .
Dounia did not sleep all night before she made up her mind , and , thinking that I was asleep , she got out of bed and was walking up and down the room all night ; at last she knelt down before the ikon and prayed long and <unk> and in the morning she told me that she had decided .
“ I have mentioned already that Pyotr Petrovitch is just setting off for Petersburg , where he has a great deal of business , and he wants to open a legal bureau .
He has been occupied for many years in <unk> civil and commercial <unk> , and only the other day he won an important case .
He has to be in Petersburg because he has an important case before the Senate .
So , Rodya dear , he may be of the greatest use to you , in every way indeed , and Dounia and I have agreed that from this very day you could <unk> enter upon your career and might consider that your future is marked out and assured for you .
Oh , if only this comes to pass !
This would be such a benefit that we could only look upon it as a <unk> blessing .
Dounia is dreaming of nothing else .
We have even ventured already to drop a few words on the subject to Pyotr Petrovitch .
He was cautious in his answer , and said that , of course , as he could not get on without a secretary , it would be better to be paying a salary to a relation than to a stranger , if only the former were fitted for the duties ( as though there could be doubt of your being fitted ! )
but then he expressed doubts whether your studies at the university would leave you time for work at his office .
The matter dropped for the time , but Dounia is thinking of nothing else now .
She has been in a sort of fever for the last few days , and has already made a regular plan for your becoming in the end an <unk> and even a partner in Pyotr Petrovitch ’ s business , which might well be , seeing that you are a student of law .
I am in complete agreement with her , Rodya , and share all her plans and hopes , and think there is every <unk> of realising them .
And in spite of Pyotr Petrovitch ’ s <unk> , very natural at present ( since he does not know you ) , Dounia is firmly persuaded that she will gain everything by her good influence over her future husband ; this she is reckoning upon .
Of course we are careful not to talk of any of these more remote plans to Pyotr Petrovitch , especially of your becoming his partner .
He is a practical man and might take this very coldly , it might all seem to him simply a <unk> .
<unk> has either Dounia or I breathed a word to him of the great hopes we have of his helping us to pay for your university studies ; we have not spoken of it in the first place , because it will come to pass of itself , later on , and he will no doubt without <unk> words offer to do it of himself , ( as though he could refuse Dounia that ) the more <unk> since you may by your own efforts become his right hand in the office , and receive this assistance not as a charity , but as a salary earned by your own work .
Dounia wants to arrange it all like this and I quite agree with her .
And we have not spoken of our plans for another reason , that is , because I particularly wanted you to feel on an equal footing when you first meet him .
When Dounia spoke to him with enthusiasm about you , he answered that one could never judge of a man without seeing him close , for oneself , and that he looked forward to forming his own opinion when he makes your acquaintance .
Do you know , my precious Rodya , I think that perhaps for some reasons ( nothing to do with Pyotr Petrovitch though , simply for my own personal , perhaps <unk> , fancies ) I should do better to go on living by myself , apart , than with them , after the wedding .
I am convinced that he will be generous and delicate enough to invite me and to <unk> me to remain with my daughter for the future , and if he has said nothing about it hitherto , it is simply because it has been taken for granted ; but I shall refuse .
I have noticed more than once in my life that <unk> don ’ t quite get on with their <unk> , and I don ’ t want to be the least bit in anyone ’ s way , and for my own sake , too , would rather be quite independent , so long as I have a crust of bread of my own , and such children as you and Dounia .
If possible , I would settle somewhere near you , for the most joyful piece of news , dear Rodya , I have kept for the end of my letter : know then , my dear boy , that we may , perhaps , be all together in a very short time and may embrace one another again after a separation of almost three years !
It is settled _ for certain _ that Dounia and I are to set off for Petersburg , exactly when I don ’ t know , but very , very soon , possibly in a week .
It all depends on Pyotr Petrovitch who will let us know when he has had time to look round him in Petersburg .
To suit his own arrangements he is anxious to have the ceremony as soon as possible , even before the fast of Our <unk> , if it could be managed , or if that is too soon to be ready , immediately after .
Oh , with what happiness I shall press you to my heart !
Dounia is all excitement at the joyful thought of seeing you , she said one day in joke that she would be ready to marry Pyotr Petrovitch for that alone .
She is an angel !
She is not writing anything to you now , and has only told me to write that she has so much , so much to tell you that she is not going to take up her pen now , for a few lines would tell you nothing , and it would only mean upsetting herself ; she <unk> me send you her love and innumerable kisses .
But although we shall be meeting so soon , perhaps I shall send you as much money as I can in a day or two .
Now that everyone has heard that Dounia is to marry Pyotr Petrovitch , my credit has suddenly <unk> and I know that Afanasy Ivanovitch will trust me now even to <unk> roubles on the security of my pension , so that perhaps I shall be able to send you twenty-five or even thirty roubles .
I would send you more , but I am uneasy about our <unk> expenses ; for though Pyotr Petrovitch has been so kind as to undertake part of the expenses of the journey , that is to say , he has taken upon himself the <unk> of our <unk> and big trunk ( which will be <unk> through some acquaintances of his ) , we must reckon upon some expense on our arrival in Petersburg , where we can ’ t be left without a halfpenny , at least for the first few days .
But we have calculated it all , Dounia and I , to the last penny , and we see that the journey will not cost very much .
It is only <unk> versts from us to the railway and we have come to an agreement with a <unk> we know , so as to be in readiness ; and from there Dounia and I can <unk> quite comfortably third class .
So that I may very likely be able to send to you not twenty-five , but thirty roubles .
But enough ; I have covered two sheets already and there is no space left for more ; our whole history , but so many events have happened !
And now , my precious Rodya , I embrace you and send you a mother ’ s blessing till we meet .
Love Dounia your sister , Rodya ; love her as she loves you and understand that she loves you beyond everything , more than herself .
She is an angel and you , Rodya , you are everything to <unk> one hope , our one consolation .
If only you are happy , we shall be happy .
Do you still say your prayers , Rodya , and believe in the mercy of our <unk> and our <unk> ?
I am afraid in my heart that you may have been visited by the new spirit of <unk> that is abroad to-day ; If it is so , I pray for you .
<unk> , dear boy , how in your childhood , when your father was living , you used to <unk> your prayers at my knee , and how happy we all were in those days .
Good-bye , till we meet <unk> embrace you warmly , warmly , with many kisses .
“ Yours till death , “ <unk> <unk> . ” Almost from the first , while he read the letter , Raskolnikov ’ s face was wet with tears ; but when he finished it , his face was pale and distorted and a bitter , <unk> and malignant smile was on his lips .
He laid his head down on his <unk> dirty pillow and pondered , pondered a long time .
His heart was beating violently , and his brain was in a <unk> .
At last he felt cramped and stifled in the little yellow room that was like a cupboard or a box .
His eyes and his mind <unk> for space .
He took up his hat and went out , this time without dread of meeting anyone ; he had forgotten his dread .
He turned in the direction of the Vassilyevsky Ostrov , walking along Vassilyevsky Prospect , as though hastening on some business , but he walked , as his habit was , without noticing his way , muttering and even speaking aloud to himself , to the astonishment of the passers-by .
Many of them took him to be drunk .
CHAPTER IV His mother ’ s letter had been a torture to him , but as regards the chief fact in it , he had felt not one moment ’ s hesitation , even whilst he was reading the letter .
The essential question was settled , and irrevocably settled , in his mind : “ Never such a marriage while I am alive and Mr. Luzhin be damned ! ” “ The thing is perfectly clear , ” he muttered to himself , with a malignant smile <unk> the triumph of his decision .
“ No , mother , no , Dounia , you won ’ t deceive me !
and then they apologise for not asking my advice and for taking the decision without me !
I dare say !
They imagine it is arranged now and can ’ t be broken off ; but we will see whether it can or not !
A magnificent excuse : ‘ Pyotr Petrovitch is such a busy man that even his wedding has to be in <unk> , almost by express . ’ No , Dounia , I see it all and I know what you want to say to me ; and I know too what you were thinking about , when you walked up and down all night , and what your prayers were like before the <unk> Mother of <unk> who stands in mother ’ s bedroom .
<unk> is the <unk> to <unk> .... Hm ... so it is finally settled ; you have determined to marry a sensible business man , Avdotya Romanovna , one who has a fortune ( has _ already _ made his fortune , that is so much more <unk> and impressive ) , a man who <unk> two government <unk> and who shares the ideas of our most rising generation , as mother writes , and who _ seems _ to be kind , as Dounia herself <unk> .
That _ seems _ <unk> everything !
And that very Dounia for that very ‘ _ seems _ ’ is marrying him !
<unk> !
splendid !
“ ...
But I should like to know why mother has written to me about ‘ our most rising generation ’ ?
Simply as a <unk> touch , or with the idea of prepossessing me in favour of Mr. Luzhin ?
Oh , the cunning of them !
I should like to know one thing more : how far they were open with one another that day and night and all this time since ?
Was it all put into _ words _ , or did both understand that they had the same thing at heart and in their <unk> , so that there was no need to speak of it aloud , and better not to speak of it .
Most likely it was partly like that , from mother ’ s letter it ’ s evident : he struck her as rude _ a little _ , and mother in her simplicity took her <unk> to Dounia .
And she was sure to be vexed and ‘ answered her angrily . ’ I should think so !
Who would not be <unk> when it was quite clear without any naïve questions and when it was understood that it was useless to discuss it .
And why does she write to me , ‘ love Dounia , Rodya , and she loves you more than herself ’ ?
Has she a secret <unk> at sacrificing her daughter to her son ?
‘ You are our one comfort , you are everything to us . ’ Oh , mother ! ” His bitterness grew more and more intense , and if he had happened to meet Mr. Luzhin at the moment , he might have murdered him .
“ Hm ... yes , that ’ s true , ” he continued , pursuing the whirling ideas that chased each other in his brain , “ it is true that ‘ it needs time and care to get to know a man , ’ but there is no mistake about Mr. Luzhin .
The chief thing is he is ‘ a man of business and _ seems _ kind , ’ that was something , wasn ’ t it , to send the <unk> and big box for them !
A kind man , no doubt after that !
But his _ bride _ and her mother are to drive in a peasant ’ s cart covered with <unk> ( I know , I have been driven in it ) .
No matter !
It is only <unk> versts and then they can ‘ <unk> very comfortably , third class , ’ for a thousand versts !
Quite right , too .
One must cut one ’ s coat according to one ’ s cloth , but what about you , Mr. Luzhin ?
She is your bride .... And you must be aware that her mother has to raise money on her pension for the journey .
To be sure it ’ s a matter of business , a partnership for mutual benefit , with equal shares and expenses ; <unk> and drink provided , but pay for your tobacco .
The business man has got the better of them , too .
The <unk> will cost less than their <unk> and very likely go for nothing .
How is it that they don ’ t both see all that , or is it that they don ’ t want to see ?
And they are pleased , pleased !
And to think that this is only the first <unk> , and that the real fruits are to come !
But what really matters is not the <unk> , is not the meanness , but the _ tone _ of the whole thing .
For that will be the tone after marriage , it ’ s a foretaste of it .
And mother too , why should she be so <unk> ?
What will she have by the time she gets to Petersburg ?
Three silver roubles or two ‘ paper ones ’ as _ she _ says .... that old woman ... hm .
What does she expect to live upon in Petersburg afterwards ?
She has her reasons already for <unk> that she _ could not _ live with Dounia after the marriage , even for the first few months .
The good man has no doubt let slip something on that subject also , though mother would deny it : ‘ I shall refuse , ’ says she .
On whom is she reckoning then ?
Is she counting on what is left of her hundred and twenty roubles of pension when Afanasy Ivanovitch ’ s debt is paid ?
She <unk> <unk> shawls and <unk> cuffs , <unk> her old eyes .
And all her shawls don ’ t add more than twenty roubles a year to her hundred and twenty , I know that .
So she is building all her hopes all the time on Mr. Luzhin ’ s <unk> ; ‘ he will offer it of himself , he will press it on me . ’ You may wait a long time for that !
That ’ s how it always is with these <unk> noble hearts ; till the last moment every <unk> is a <unk> with them , till the last moment , they hope for the best and will see nothing wrong , and although they have an <unk> of the other side of the picture , yet they won ’ t face the truth till they are forced to ; the very thought of it makes them shiver ; they thrust the truth away with both hands , until the man they <unk> out in false colours puts a fool ’ s cap on them with his own hands .
I should like to know whether Mr. Luzhin has any orders of merit ; I bet he has the <unk> in his <unk> and that he puts it on when he goes to <unk> with <unk> or <unk> .
He will be sure to have it for his wedding , too !
Enough of him , confound him !
“ Well , ... mother I don ’ t wonder at , it ’ s like her , God bless her , but how could Dounia ?
Dounia darling , as though I did not know you !
You were nearly twenty when I saw you last : I understood you then .
Mother writes that ‘ Dounia can put up with a great deal . ’ I know that very well .
I knew that two years and a half ago , and for the last two and a half years I have been thinking about it , thinking of just that , that ‘ Dounia can put up with a great deal . ’ If she could put up with Mr. Svidrigaïlov and all the rest of it , she certainly can put up with a great deal .
And now mother and she have taken it into their heads that she can put up with Mr. Luzhin , who <unk> the theory of the <unk> of <unk> raised from <unk> and owing everything to their husband ’ s <unk> <unk> it , too , almost at the first interview .
Granted that he ‘ let it slip , ’ though he is a sensible man , ( yet maybe it was not a slip at all , but he meant to make himself clear as soon as possible ) but Dounia , Dounia ?
She understands the man , of course , but she will have to live with the man .
Why !
she ’ d live on black bread and water , she would not sell her soul , she would not <unk> her moral freedom for comfort ; she would not <unk> it for all <unk> , much less Mr. Luzhin ’ s money .
No , Dounia was not that sort when I knew her and ... she is still the same , of course !
Yes , there ’ s no denying , the Svidrigaïlovs are a bitter <unk> !
It ’ s a bitter thing to spend one ’ s life a governess in the provinces for two hundred roubles , but I know she would rather be a <unk> on a <unk> or a <unk> with a German master than <unk> her soul , and her moral dignity , by <unk> herself for ever to a man whom she does not respect and with whom she has nothing in <unk> her own advantage .
And if Mr. Luzhin had been of <unk> gold , or one huge <unk> , she would never have consented to become his legal <unk> .
Why is she <unk> then ?
What ’ s the point of it ?
What ’ s the answer ?
It ’ s clear enough : for herself , for her comfort , to save her life she would not sell herself , but for someone else she is doing it !
For one she loves , for one she <unk> , she will sell herself !
That ’ s what it all <unk> to ; for her brother , for her mother , she will sell herself !
She will sell everything !
In such cases , ‘ we overcome our moral feeling if necessary , ’ freedom , peace , conscience even , all , all are brought into the market .
Let my life go , if only my dear ones may be happy !
<unk> than that , we become <unk> , we learn to be <unk> and for a time maybe we can <unk> ourselves , we can persuade ourselves that it is one ’ s duty for a good object .
That ’ s just like us , it ’ s as clear as daylight .
It ’ s clear that Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov is the <unk> figure in the business , and no one else .
Oh , yes , she can <unk> his happiness , keep him in the university , make him a partner in the office , make his whole future secure ; perhaps he may even be a rich man later on , <unk> , respected , and may even end his life a famous man !
But my mother ?
It ’ s all Rodya , precious Rodya , her first born !
For such a son who would not sacrifice such a daughter !
Oh , <unk> , <unk> hearts !
Why , for his sake we would not <unk> even from Sonia ’ s fate .
Sonia , Sonia Marmeladov , the eternal victim so long as the world <unk> .
Have you taken the measure of your sacrifice , both of you ?
Is it right ?
Can you bear it ?
Is it any use ?
Is there sense in it ?
And let me tell you , Dounia , Sonia ’ s life is no worse than life with Mr. Luzhin .
‘ There can be no question of love , ’ mother writes .
And what if there can be no respect either , if on the contrary there is aversion , contempt , repulsion , what then ?
So you will have to ‘ keep up your appearance , ’ too .
Is not that so ?
Do you understand what that smartness means ?
Do you understand that the Luzhin smartness is just the same thing as Sonia ’ s and may be worse , <unk> , <unk> , because in your case , Dounia , it ’ s a <unk> for <unk> , after all , but with Sonia it ’ s simply a question of <unk> .
It has to be paid for , it has to be paid for , Dounia , this smartness .
And what if it ’ s more than you can bear afterwards , if you regret it ?
The bitterness , the misery , the curses , the tears hidden from all the world , for you are not a Marfa Petrovna .
And how will your mother feel then ?
Even now she is uneasy , she is worried , but then , when she sees it all clearly ?
