They are on the canal bank , near the bridge now , not far from Sofya Semyonovna ’ s , quite close . ” On the canal bank near the bridge and not two houses away from the one where Sonia lodged , there was a crowd of people , consisting <unk> of gutter children .
The hoarse broken voice of Katerina Ivanovna could be heard from the bridge , and it certainly was a strange spectacle likely to attract a street crowd .
Katerina Ivanovna in her old dress with the green shawl , wearing a torn straw hat , crushed in a hideous way on one side , was really frantic .
She was exhausted and breathless .
Her wasted consumptive face looked more suffering than ever , and indeed out of doors in the sunshine a consumptive always looks worse than at home .
But her excitement did not <unk> , and every moment her irritation grew more intense .
She rushed at the children , shouted at them , <unk> them , told them before the crowd how to dance and what to sing , began explaining to them why it was necessary , and driven to <unk> by their not understanding , beat them .... Then she would make a rush at the crowd ; if she noticed any <unk> dressed person stopping to look , she immediately <unk> to him to see what these children “ from a genteel , one may say aristocratic , house ” had been brought to .
If she heard laughter or jeering in the crowd , she would rush at once at the <unk> and begin <unk> with them .
Some people laughed , others shook their heads , but everyone felt curious at the sight of the <unk> with the frightened children .
The <unk> of which Lebeziatnikov had spoken was not there , at least Raskolnikov did not see it .
But instead of <unk> on the pan , Katerina Ivanovna began <unk> her wasted hands , when she made Lida and Kolya dance and Polenka sing .
She too joined in the singing , but broke down at the second note with a fearful cough , which made her curse in despair and even shed tears .
What made her most furious was the weeping and terror of Kolya and Lida .
Some effort had been made to dress the children up as street singers are dressed .
The boy had on a <unk> made of something red and white to look like a <unk> .
There had been no <unk> for Lida ; she simply had a red knitted cap , or rather a night cap that had belonged to Marmeladov , decorated with a broken piece of white <unk> feather , which had been Katerina Ivanovna ’ s grandmother ’ s and had been <unk> as a family possession .
Polenka was in her <unk> dress ; she looked in timid perplexity at her mother , and kept at her side , hiding her tears .
She dimly realised her mother ’ s condition , and looked uneasily about her .
She was terribly frightened of the street and the crowd .
Sonia followed Katerina Ivanovna , weeping and <unk> her to return home , but Katerina Ivanovna was not to be persuaded .
“ Leave off , Sonia , leave off , ” she shouted , speaking fast , panting and coughing .
“ You don ’ t know what you ask ; you are like a child !
I ’ ve told you before that I am not coming back to that drunken German .
Let everyone , let all Petersburg see the children begging in the streets , though their father was an honourable man who served all his life in truth and <unk> , and one may say died in the service . ” ( Katerina Ivanovna had by now invented this fantastic story and thoroughly believed it . )
“ Let that wretch of a general see it !
And you are silly , Sonia : what have we to eat ?
Tell me that .
We have worried you enough , I won ’ t go on so !
Ah , Rodion Romanovitch , is that you ? ” she cried , seeing Raskolnikov and rushing up to him .
“ <unk> to this silly girl , please , that nothing better could be done !
Even <unk> earn their living , and everyone will see at once that we are different , that we are an honourable and <unk> family reduced to beggary .
And that general will lose his post , you ’ ll see !
We shall perform under his windows every day , and if the <unk> <unk> by , I ’ ll fall on my knees , put the children before me , show them to him , and say ‘ Defend us father . ’ He is the father of the <unk> , he is merciful , he ’ ll protect us , you ’ ll see , and that wretch of a general .... Lida , _ <unk> vous <unk> _ !
Kolya , you ’ ll dance again .
Why are you whimpering ?
<unk> again !
What are you afraid of , stupid ?
<unk> , what am I to do with them , Rodion Romanovitch ?
If you only knew how stupid they are !
What ’ s one to do with such children ? ” And she , almost crying <unk> did not stop her <unk> , rapid flow of <unk> to the crying children .
Raskolnikov tried to persuade her to go home , and even said , hoping to work on her vanity , that it was unseemly for her to be wandering about the streets like an <unk> , as she was intending to become the principal of a boarding-school .
“ A boarding-school , ha-ha-ha !
A <unk> in the air , ” cried Katerina Ivanovna , her laugh ending in a cough .
“ No , Rodion Romanovitch , that dream is over !
All have <unk> us ! ...
And that general .... You know , Rodion Romanovitch , I threw an <unk> at <unk> happened to be standing in the <unk> by the paper where you sign your name .
I wrote my name , threw it at him and ran away .
Oh , the scoundrels , the scoundrels !
But enough of them , now I ’ ll provide for the children myself , I won ’ t bow down to anybody !
She has had to bear enough for us ! ” she pointed to Sonia .
“ Polenka , how much have you got ?
Show me !
What , only two farthings !
Oh , the mean wretches !
They give us nothing , only run after us , putting their <unk> out .
There , what is that blockhead laughing at ? ” ( She pointed to a man in the crowd . )
“ It ’ s all because Kolya here is so stupid ; I have such a bother with him .
What do you want , Polenka ?
Tell me in French , _ <unk> <unk> _ .
Why , I ’ ve taught you , you know some phrases .
<unk> how are you to show that you are of good family , well <unk> children , and not at all like other <unk> ?
We aren ’ t going to have a <unk> and <unk> show in the street , but to sing a genteel song .... Ah , yes , ... What are we to sing ?
You keep putting me out , but we ... you see , we are standing here , Rodion Romanovitch , to find something to sing and get money , something Kolya can dance to .... For , as you can fancy , our <unk> is all <unk> .... We must talk it over and <unk> it all thoroughly , and then we shall go to <unk> , where there are far more people of good society , and we shall be noticed at once .
Lida knows ‘ My Village ’ only , nothing but ‘ My Village , ’ and everyone <unk> that .
We must sing something far more genteel .... Well , have you thought of anything , Polenka ?
If only you ’ d help your mother !
My memory ’ s quite gone , or I should have thought of something .
We really can ’ t sing ‘ An <unk> . ’ Ah , let us sing in French , ‘ Cinq sous , ’ I have taught it you , I have taught it you .
And as it is in French , people will see at once that you are children of good family , and that will be much more touching .... You might sing ‘ <unk> s ’ en <unk> guerre , ’ for that ’ s quite a child ’ s song and is sung as a <unk> in all the aristocratic houses .
“ _ <unk> s ’ en <unk> guerre <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> _ ... ” she began singing .
“ But no , better sing ‘ Cinq sous . ’ Now , Kolya , your hands on your <unk> , make haste , and you , Lida , keep turning the other way , and Polenka and I will sing and clap our hands !
“ _ Cinq sous , <unk> sous <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> _ . ” ( Cough-cough-cough ! )
“ <unk> your dress straight , Polenka , it ’ s slipped down on your shoulders , ” she observed , panting from coughing .
“ Now it ’ s particularly necessary to behave nicely and <unk> , that all may see that you are <unk> children .
I said at the time that the <unk> should be cut longer , and made of two <unk> .
It was your fault , Sonia , with your advice to make it <unk> , and now you see the child is quite <unk> by it .... Why , you ’ re all crying again !
What ’ s the matter , <unk> ?
Come , Kolya , begin .
Make haste , make haste !
Oh , what an unbearable child !
“ Cinq sous , <unk> sous .
“ A policeman again !
What do you want ? ” A policeman was indeed forcing his way through the crowd .
But at that moment a gentleman in <unk> uniform and an <unk> <unk> official of about fifty with a <unk> on his neck ( which delighted Katerina Ivanovna and had its effect on the policeman ) <unk> and without a word handed her a green <unk> note .
His face wore a look of genuine sympathy .
Katerina Ivanovna took it and gave him a polite , even <unk> , bow .
“ I thank you , honoured sir , ” she began <unk> .
“ The causes that have induced us ( take the money , Polenka : you see there are generous and honourable people who are ready to help a poor <unk> in distress ) .
You see , honoured sir , these orphans of good <unk> might even say of aristocratic <unk> that wretch of a general sat eating <unk> ... and <unk> at my disturbing him .
‘ Your excellency , ’ I said , ‘ protect the orphans , for you knew my late husband , Semyon Zaharovitch , and on the very day of his death the <unk> of scoundrels <unk> his only daughter . ’ ... That policeman again !
<unk> me , ” she cried to the official .
“ Why is that policeman <unk> up to me ?
We have only just run away from one of them .
What do you want , fool ? ” “ It ’ s forbidden in the streets .
You mustn ’ t make a disturbance . ” “ It ’ s you ’ re making a disturbance .
It ’ s just the same as if I were grinding an organ .
What business is it of yours ? ” “ You have to get a <unk> for an organ , and you haven ’ t got one , and in that way you collect a crowd .
Where do you lodge ? ” “ What , a license ? ” wailed Katerina Ivanovna .
“ I buried my husband to-day .
What need of a license ? ” “ <unk> yourself , madam , calm yourself , ” began the official .
“ Come along ; I will escort you ....
This is no place for you in the crowd .
You are ill . ” “ Honoured sir , honoured sir , you don ’ t know , ” screamed Katerina Ivanovna .
“ We are going to the <unk> .... Sonia , Sonia !
Where is she ?
She is crying too !
What ’ s the matter with you all ?
Kolya , Lida , where are you going ? ” she cried suddenly in alarm .
“ Oh , silly children !
Kolya , Lida , where are they off to ? ... ” Kolya and Lida , scared out of their <unk> by the crowd , and their mother ’ s mad pranks , suddenly seized each other by the hand , and ran off at the sight of the policeman who wanted to take them away somewhere .
Weeping and wailing , poor Katerina Ivanovna ran after them .
She was a <unk> and unseemly spectacle , as she ran , weeping and panting for breath .
Sonia and Polenka rushed after them .
“ Bring them back , bring them back , Sonia !
Oh stupid , ungrateful children ! ...
Polenka !
catch them .... It ’ s for your <unk> I ... ” She stumbled as she ran and fell down .
“ She ’ s cut herself , she ’ s bleeding !
Oh , dear ! ” cried Sonia , bending over her .
All ran up and crowded around .
Raskolnikov and Lebeziatnikov were the first at her side , the official too hastened up , and behind him the policeman who muttered , “ Bother ! ” with a gesture of impatience , feeling that the job was going to be a <unk> one .
“ Pass on !
Pass on ! ” he said to the crowd that pressed forward .
“ She ’ s dying , ” someone shouted .
“ She ’ s gone out of her mind , ” said another .
“ Lord have mercy upon us , ” said a woman , crossing herself .
“ Have they caught the little girl and the boy ?
They ’ re being brought back , the elder one ’ s got them .... Ah , the <unk> <unk> ! ” When they examined Katerina Ivanovna carefully , they saw that she had not cut herself against a stone , as Sonia thought , but that the blood that stained the pavement red was from her chest .
“ I ’ ve seen that before , ” muttered the official to Raskolnikov and Lebeziatnikov ; “ that ’ s consumption ; the blood <unk> and <unk> the patient .
I saw the same thing with a relative of my own not long ago ... nearly a pint of blood , all in a minute .... What ’ s to be done though ?
She is dying . ” “ This way , this way , to my room ! ” Sonia implored .
“ I live here ! ...
See , that house , the second from here .... Come to me , make haste , ” she turned from one to the other .
“ <unk> for the doctor !
Oh , dear ! ” Thanks to the official ’ s efforts , this plan was <unk> , the policeman even helping to carry Katerina Ivanovna .
She was carried to Sonia ’ s room , almost unconscious , and laid on the bed .
The blood was still <unk> , but she seemed to be coming to herself .
Raskolnikov , Lebeziatnikov , and the official accompanied Sonia into the room and were followed by the policeman , who first drove back the crowd which followed to the very door .
Polenka came in holding Kolya and Lida , who were trembling and weeping .
Several persons came in too from the Kapernaumovs ’ room ; the <unk> , a lame <unk> man of strange appearance with whiskers and hair that stood up like a brush , his wife , a woman with an <unk> scared expression , and several <unk> children with <unk> faces .
Among these , Svidrigaïlov suddenly made his appearance .
Raskolnikov looked at him with surprise , not understanding where he had come from and not having noticed him in the crowd .
A doctor and priest wore spoken of .
The official whispered to Raskolnikov that he thought it was too late now for the doctor , but he ordered him to be sent for .
Kapernaumov ran himself .
Meanwhile Katerina Ivanovna had regained her breath .
The bleeding ceased for a time .
She looked with sick but intent and <unk> eyes at Sonia , who stood pale and trembling , wiping the sweat from her <unk> with a handkerchief .
At last she asked to be raised .
They sat her up on the bed , supporting her on both sides .
“ Where are the children ? ” she said in a faint voice .
“ You ’ ve brought them , Polenka ?
Oh the <unk> !
Why did you run away .... <unk> ! ” Once more her parched lips were covered with blood .
She moved her eyes , looking about her .
“ So that ’ s how you live , Sonia !
Never once have I been in your room . ” She looked at her with a face of suffering .
“ We have been your ruin , Sonia .
Polenka , Lida , Kolya , come here !
Well , here they are , Sonia , take them all !
I hand them over to you , I ’ ve had enough !
The ball is over . ” ( Cough ! )
“ <unk> me down , let me die in peace . ” They laid her back on the pillow .
“ What , the priest ?
I don ’ t want him .
You haven ’ t got a rouble to spare .
I have no sins .
God must forgive me without that .
He knows how I have suffered .... And if He won ’ t forgive me , I don ’ t care ! ” She sank more and more into uneasy delirium .
At times she shuddered , turned her eyes from side to side , recognised everyone for a minute , but at once sank into delirium again .
Her breathing was hoarse and difficult , there was a sort of <unk> in her throat .
“ I said to him , your excellency , ” she ejaculated , gasping after each word .
“ That Amalia Ludwigovna , ah !
Lida , Kolya , hands on your <unk> , make haste !
_ <unk> , <unk> !
<unk> de <unk> ! _ <unk> with your heels , be a graceful child !
“ _ <unk> hast <unk> <unk> <unk> _ “ What next ?
That ’ s the thing to sing .
“ _ <unk> hast die <unk> <unk> <unk> , was <unk> <unk> <unk> ? _ “ What an idea !
_ Was <unk> <unk> <unk> ? _ What things the fool <unk> !
Ah , yes !
“ In the heat of <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
“ Ah , how I loved it !
I loved that song to distraction , Polenka !
Your father , you know , used to sing it when we were engaged .... Oh those days !
Oh that ’ s the thing for us to sing !
How does it go ?
I ’ ve forgotten .
<unk> me !
How was it ? ” She was violently excited and tried to sit up .
At last , in a horribly hoarse , broken voice , she began , shrieking and gasping at every word , with a look of growing terror .
“ In the heat of <unk> ! ...
in the <unk> ! ...
of <unk> ! ...
With lead in my breast ! ... ” “ Your excellency ! ” she wailed suddenly with a <unk> scream and a <unk> of tears , “ protect the orphans !
You have been their father ’ s guest ... one may say aristocratic .... ” She started , <unk> consciousness , and gazed at all with a sort of terror , but at once recognised Sonia .
“ Sonia , Sonia ! ” she articulated softly and <unk> , as though surprised to find her there .
“ Sonia darling , are you here , too ? ” They lifted her up again .
“ Enough !
It ’ s over !
<unk> , poor thing !
I am done for !
I am broken ! ” she cried with vindictive despair , and her head fell heavily back on the pillow .
She sank into <unk> again , but this time it did not last long .
Her pale , yellow , wasted face dropped back , her mouth fell open , her leg moved convulsively , she gave a deep , deep sigh and died .
Sonia fell upon her , flung her arms about her , and remained motionless with her head pressed to the dead woman ’ s wasted bosom .
Polenka threw herself at her mother ’ s feet , kissing them and weeping violently .
Though Kolya and Lida did not understand what had happened , they had a feeling that it was something terrible ; they put their hands on each other ’ s little shoulders , stared straight at one another and both at once opened their <unk> and began screaming .
They were both still in their fancy dress ; one in a <unk> , the other in the cap with the <unk> feather .
And how did “ the certificate of merit ” come to be on the bed beside Katerina Ivanovna ?
It lay there by the pillow ; Raskolnikov saw it .
He walked away to the window .
Lebeziatnikov <unk> up to him .
“ She is dead , ” he said .
“ Rodion Romanovitch , I must have two words with you , ” said Svidrigaïlov , coming up to them .
Lebeziatnikov at once made room for him and <unk> withdrew .
Svidrigaïlov drew Raskolnikov further away .
“ I will undertake all the arrangements , the funeral and that .
You know it ’ s a question of money and , as I told you , I have plenty to spare .
I will put those two little ones and Polenka into some good orphan <unk> , and I will settle fifteen hundred roubles to be paid to each on coming of age , so that Sofya Semyonovna need have no anxiety about them .
And I will pull her out of the mud too , for she is a good girl , isn ’ t she ?
So tell Avdotya Romanovna that that is how I am spending her ten thousand . ” “ What is your motive for such benevolence ? ” asked Raskolnikov .
“ Ah !
you <unk> person ! ” laughed Svidrigaïlov .
“ I told you I had no need of that money .
Won ’ t you admit that it ’ s simply done from humanity ?
She wasn ’ t ‘ a louse , ’ you know ” ( he pointed to the corner where the dead woman lay ) , “ was she , like some old pawnbroker woman ?
Come , you ’ ll agree , is Luzhin to go on living , and doing wicked things or is she to die ?
And if I didn ’ t help them , Polenka would go the same way . ” He said this with an air of a sort of gay winking slyness , keeping his eyes fixed on Raskolnikov , who turned white and cold , hearing his own phrases , spoken to Sonia .
He quickly stepped back and looked wildly at Svidrigaïlov .
“ How do you know ? ” he whispered , hardly able to breathe .
“ Why , I lodge here at Madame Resslich ’ s , the other side of the wall .
Here is Kapernaumov , and there lives Madame Resslich , an old and devoted friend of mine .
I am a neighbour . ” “ You ? ” “ Yes , ” continued Svidrigaïlov , shaking with laughter .
“ I assure you on my honour , dear Rodion Romanovitch , that you have interested me <unk> .
I told you we should become friends , I <unk> it .
Well , here we have .
And you will see what an <unk> person I am .
You ’ ll see that you can get on with me ! ” PART VI CHAPTER I A strange period began for Raskolnikov : it was as though a <unk> had fallen upon him and wrapped him in a <unk> solitude from which there was no escape .
<unk> that period long after , he believed that his mind had been clouded at times , and that it had continued so , with <unk> , till the final <unk> .
He was convinced that he had been mistaken about many things at that time , for instance as to the date of certain events .
Anyway , when he tried later on to piece his <unk> together , he learnt a great deal about himself from what other people told him .
He had mixed up <unk> and had explained events as due to circumstances which <unk> only in his imagination .
At times he was a <unk> to agonies of morbid uneasiness , <unk> sometimes to panic .
But he remembered , too , moments , hours , perhaps whole days , of complete apathy , which came upon him as a <unk> from his previous terror and might be compared with the abnormal <unk> , sometimes seen in the dying .
He seemed to be trying in that latter stage to escape from a full and clear understanding of his position .
<unk> essential facts which required immediate consideration were particularly <unk> to him .
How glad he would have been to be free from some cares , the <unk> of which would have <unk> him with complete , inevitable ruin .
He was particularly worried about Svidrigaïlov , he might be said to be <unk> thinking of Svidrigaïlov .
From the time of Svidrigaïlov ’ s too menacing and unmistakable words in Sonia ’ s room at the moment of Katerina Ivanovna ’ s death , the normal working of his mind seemed to break down .
But although this new fact caused him extreme uneasiness , Raskolnikov was in no hurry for an explanation of it .
At times , finding himself in a solitary and remote part of the town , in some wretched eating-house , sitting alone lost in thought , hardly knowing how he had come there , he suddenly thought of Svidrigaïlov .
He recognised suddenly , clearly , and with dismay that he ought at once to come to an understanding with that man and to make what terms he could .
Walking outside the <unk> gates one day , he positively fancied that they had fixed a meeting there , that he was waiting for Svidrigaïlov .
Another time he woke up before daybreak lying on the ground under some bushes and could not at first understand how he had come there .
But during the two or three days after Katerina Ivanovna ’ s death , he had two or three times met Svidrigaïlov at Sonia ’ s lodging , where he had gone aimlessly for a moment .
They exchanged a few words and made no <unk> to the vital subject , as though they were <unk> agreed not to speak of it for a time .
Katerina Ivanovna ’ s body was still lying in the coffin , Svidrigaïlov was busy making arrangements for the funeral .
Sonia too was very busy .
At their last meeting Svidrigaïlov informed Raskolnikov that he had made an arrangement , and a very satisfactory one , for Katerina Ivanovna ’ s children ; that he had , through certain connections , succeeded in getting hold of certain personages by whose help the three orphans could be at once <unk> in very suitable <unk> ; that the money he had settled on them had been of great assistance , as it is much easier to place orphans with some property than destitute ones .
He said something too about Sonia and promised to come himself in a day or two to see Raskolnikov , mentioning that “ he would like to <unk> with him , that there were things they must talk over .... ” This conversation took place in the passage on the stairs .
Svidrigaïlov looked intently at Raskolnikov and suddenly , after a brief pause , dropping his voice , asked : “ But how is it , Rodion Romanovitch ; you don ’ t seem yourself ?
You look and you listen , but you don ’ t seem to understand .
<unk> up !
We ’ ll talk things over ; I am only sorry , I ’ ve so much to do of my own business and other people ’ s .
Ah , Rodion Romanovitch , ” he added suddenly , “ what all men need is fresh air , fresh air ... more than anything ! ” He moved to one side to make way for the priest and <unk> , who were coming up the stairs .
They had come for the requiem service .
By Svidrigaïlov ’ s orders it was sung twice a day punctually .
Svidrigaïlov went his way .
Raskolnikov stood still a moment , thought , and followed the priest into Sonia ’ s room .
He stood at the door .
They began quietly , slowly and mournfully singing the service .
From his childhood the thought of death and the presence of death had something oppressive and <unk> awful ; and it was long since he had heard the requiem service .
And there was something else here as well , too awful and disturbing .
He looked at the children : they were all <unk> by the coffin ; Polenka was weeping .
Behind them Sonia prayed , softly and , as it were , timidly weeping .
“ These last two days she hasn ’ t said a word to me , she hasn ’ t glanced at me , ” Raskolnikov thought suddenly .
The sunlight was bright in the room ; the <unk> rose in clouds ; the priest read , “ Give rest , oh Lord .... ” Raskolnikov stayed all through the service .
As he <unk> them and took his leave , the priest looked round strangely .
After the service , Raskolnikov went up to Sonia .
She took both his hands and let her head sink on his shoulder .
This slight friendly gesture bewildered Raskolnikov .
It seemed strange to him that there was no trace of repugnance , no trace of disgust , no tremor in her hand .
It was the furthest limit of <unk> , at least so he <unk> it .
Sonia said nothing .
Raskolnikov pressed her hand and went out .
He felt very miserable .
If it had been possible to escape to some solitude , he would have thought himself <unk> , even if he had to spend his whole life there .
But although he had almost always been by himself of late , he had never been able to feel alone .
Sometimes he walked out of the town on to the high road , once he had even reached a little wood , but the <unk> the place was , the more he seemed to be aware of an uneasy presence near him .
It did not frighten him , but greatly annoyed him , so that he made haste to return to the town , to <unk> with the crowd , to enter <unk> and taverns , to walk in busy <unk> .
There he felt easier and even more solitary .
One day at dusk he sat for an hour listening to <unk> in a tavern and he remembered that he positively enjoyed it .
But at last he had suddenly felt the same uneasiness again , as though his conscience <unk> him .
“ Here I sit listening to singing , is that what I ought to be doing ? ” he thought .
Yet he felt at once that that was not the only cause of his uneasiness ; there was something <unk> immediate decision , but it was something he could not clearly understand or put into words .
It was a hopeless tangle .
“ No , better the struggle again !
Better Porfiry again ... or Svidrigaïlov ....
Better some challenge again ... some attack .
Yes , yes ! ” he thought .
He went out of the tavern and rushed away almost at a run .
The thought of Dounia and his mother suddenly reduced him almost to a panic .
That night he woke up before morning among some bushes in <unk> Island , trembling all over with fever ; he walked home , and it was early morning when he arrived .
After some hours ’ sleep the fever left him , but he woke up late , two o ’ clock in the afternoon .
He remembered that Katerina Ivanovna ’ s funeral had been fixed for that day , and was glad that he was not present at it .
Nastasya brought him some food ; he ate and drank with appetite , almost with <unk> .
His head was <unk> and he was <unk> than he had been for the last three days .
He even felt a passing wonder at his previous attacks of panic .
The door opened and Razumihin came in .
“ Ah , he ’ s eating , then he ’ s not ill , ” said Razumihin .
He took a chair and sat down at the table opposite Raskolnikov .
He was troubled and did not attempt to conceal it .
He spoke with evident annoyance , but without hurry or raising his voice .
He looked as though he had some special fixed determination .
“ Listen , ” he began resolutely .
“ As far as I am concerned , you may all go to hell , but from what I see , it ’ s clear to me that I can ’ t make head or tail of it ; please don ’ t think I ’ ve come to ask you questions .
I don ’ t want to know , hang it !
If you begin telling me your secrets , I dare say I shouldn ’ t stay to listen , I should go away cursing .
I have only come to find out once for all whether it ’ s a fact that you are mad ?
There is a conviction in the air that you are mad or very nearly so .
I admit I ’ ve been disposed to that opinion myself , judging from your stupid , <unk> and quite inexplicable actions , and from your recent <unk> to your mother and sister .
Only a monster or a madman could treat them as you have ; so you must be mad . ” “ When did you see them last ? ” “ Just now .
Haven ’ t you seen them since then ?
What have you been doing with yourself ?
Tell me , please .
I ’ ve been to you three times already .
Your mother has been seriously ill since yesterday .
She had made up her mind to come to you ; Avdotya Romanovna tried to prevent her ; she wouldn ’ t hear a word .
‘ If he is ill , if his mind is giving way , who can look after him like his mother ? ’ she said .
We all came here together , we couldn ’ t let her come alone all the way .
We kept begging her to be calm .
We came in , you weren ’ t here ; she sat down , and stayed ten minutes , while we stood waiting in silence .
She got up and said : ‘ If he ’ s gone out , that is , if he is well , and has forgotten his mother , it ’ s humiliating and unseemly for his mother to stand at his door begging for kindness . ’ She returned home and took to her bed ; now she is in a fever .
‘ I see , ’ she said , ‘ that he has time for _ his girl _ . ’ She means by _ your girl _ Sofya Semyonovna , your betrothed or your mistress , I don ’ t know .
I went at once to Sofya Semyonovna ’ s , for I wanted to know what was going on .
I looked round , I saw the coffin , the children crying , and Sofya Semyonovna trying them on mourning dresses .
No sign of you .
I <unk> , came away , and <unk> to Avdotya Romanovna .
So that ’ s all nonsense and you haven ’ t got a girl ; the most likely thing is that you are mad .
But here you sit , <unk> boiled beef as though you ’ d not had a <unk> for three days .
Though as far as that goes , madmen eat too , but though you have not said a word to me yet ... you are not mad !
That I ’ d swear !
Above all , you are not mad !
So you may go to hell , all of you , for there ’ s some mystery , some secret about it , and I don ’ t intend to worry my brains over your secrets .
So I ’ ve simply come to swear at you , ” he finished , getting up , “ to <unk> my mind .
And I know what to do now . ” “ What do you mean to do now ? ” “ What business is it of yours what I mean to do ? ” “ You are going in for a drinking <unk> . ” “ How ... how did you know ? ” “ Why , it ’ s pretty plain . ” Razumihin paused for a minute .
“ You always have been a very rational person and you ’ ve never been mad , never , ” he observed suddenly with warmth .
“ You ’ re right : I shall drink .
Good-bye ! ” And he moved to go out .
“ I was talking with my <unk> day before yesterday , I think it <unk> you , Razumihin . ” “ About me !
But ... where can you have seen her the day before yesterday ? ” Razumihin stopped short and even turned a little pale .
One could see that his heart was throbbing slowly and violently .
“ She came here by herself , sat there and talked to me . ” “ She did ! ” “ Yes . ” “ What did you say to her ...
I mean , about me ? ” “ I told her you were a very good , honest , and <unk> man .
I didn ’ t tell her you love her , because she knows that herself . ” “ She knows that herself ? ” “ Well , it ’ s pretty plain .
<unk> I might go , whatever happened to me , you would remain to look after them .
I , so to speak , give them into your keeping , Razumihin .
I say this because I know quite well how you love her , and am convinced of the purity of your heart .
I know that she too may love you and perhaps does love you already .
Now decide for yourself , as you know best , whether you need go in for a drinking <unk> or not . ” “ Rodya !
You see ... well .... Ach , damn it !
But where do you mean to go ?
Of course , if it ’ s all a secret , never mind ....
But I ...
I shall find out the secret ... and I am sure that it must be some ridiculous nonsense and that you ’ ve made it all up .
Anyway you are a capital fellow , a capital fellow ! ... ” “ That was just what I wanted to add , only you interrupted , that that was a very good decision of yours not to find out these secrets .
Leave it to time , don ’ t worry about it .
You ’ ll know it all in time when it must be .
Yesterday a man said to me that what a man needs is fresh air , fresh air , fresh air .
I mean to go to him directly to find out what he meant by that . ” Razumihin stood lost in thought and excitement , making a silent conclusion .
“ He ’ s a political <unk> !
He must be .
And he ’ s on the <unk> of some desperate step , that ’ s certain .
It can only be that !
And ... and Dounia knows , ” he thought suddenly .
“ So Avdotya Romanovna comes to see you , ” he said , weighing each syllable , “ and you ’ re going to see a man who says we need more air , and so of course that letter ... that too must have something to do with it , ” he concluded to himself .
“ What letter ? ” “ She got a letter to-day .
It upset her very <unk> much indeed .
Too much so .
I began speaking of you , she begged me not to .
Then ... then she said that perhaps we should very soon have to part ... then she began warmly thanking me for something ; then she went to her room and locked herself in . ” “ She got a letter ? ” Raskolnikov asked thoughtfully .
“ Yes , and you didn ’ t know ?
hm ... ” They were both silent .
“ Good-bye , Rodion .
There was a time , brother , when I .... Never mind , good-bye .
You see , there was a time .... Well , good-bye !
I must be off too .
I am not going to drink .
There ’ s no need now .... That ’ s all stuff ! ” He hurried out ; but when he had almost closed the door behind him , he suddenly opened it again , and said , looking away : “ Oh , by the way , do you remember that murder , you know Porfiry ’ s , that old woman ?
Do you know the murderer has been found , he has confessed and given the proofs .
It ’ s one of those very workmen , the painter , only fancy !
Do you remember I <unk> them here ?
Would you believe it , all that scene of fighting and laughing with his <unk> on the stairs while the porter and the two witnesses were going up , he got up on purpose to disarm suspicion .
The cunning , the presence of mind of the young dog !
One can hardly credit it ; but it ’ s his own explanation , he has confessed it all .
And what a fool I was about it !
Well , he ’ s simply a genius of <unk> and <unk> in <unk> the suspicions of the <unk> there ’ s nothing much to wonder at , I suppose !
Of course people like that are always possible .
And the fact that he couldn ’ t keep up the character , but confessed , makes him easier to believe in .
But what a fool I was !
I was frantic on their side ! ” “ Tell me , please , from whom did you hear that , and why does it interest you so ? ” Raskolnikov asked with unmistakable agitation .
“ What next ?
You ask me why it interests me ! ...
Well , I heard it from Porfiry , among others ...
It was from him I heard almost all about it . ” “ From Porfiry ? ” “ From Porfiry . ” “ What ... what did he say ? ” Raskolnikov asked in dismay .
“ He gave me a capital explanation of it .
<unk> , after his fashion . ” “ He explained it ?
<unk> it himself ? ” “ Yes , yes ; good-bye .
I ’ ll tell you all about it another time , but now I ’ m busy .
There was a time when I fancied ...
But no matter , another time ! ...
What need is there for me to drink now ?
You have made me drunk without wine .
I am drunk , Rodya !
Good-bye , I ’ m going .
I ’ ll come again very soon . ” He went out .
“ He ’ s a political <unk> , there ’ s not a doubt about it , ” Razumihin decided , as he slowly <unk> the stairs .
“ And he ’ s drawn his sister in ; that ’ s quite , quite in keeping with Avdotya Romanovna ’ s character .
There are interviews between them ! ...
She hinted at it too ...
So many of her words .... and <unk> ... bear that meaning !
And how else can all this tangle be explained ?
Hm !
And I was almost thinking ... Good heavens , what I thought !
Yes , I took leave of my senses and I wronged him !
It was his doing , under the lamp in the corridor that day .
Pfoo !
What a <unk> , nasty , vile idea on my part !
Nikolay is a brick , for confessing .... And how clear it all is now !
His illness then , all his strange actions ... before this , in the university , how morose he used to be , how gloomy ....
But what ’ s the meaning now of that letter ?
There ’ s something in that , too , perhaps .
Whom was it from ?
I suspect ... !
No , I must find out ! ” He thought of Dounia , realising all he had heard and his heart throbbed , and he suddenly broke into a run .
As soon as Razumihin went out , Raskolnikov got up , turned to the window , walked into one corner and then into another , as though forgetting the <unk> of his room , and sat down again on the sofa .
He felt , so to speak , renewed ; again the struggle , so a means of escape had come .
“ Yes , a means of escape had come !
It had been too stifling , too <unk> , the burden had been too agonising .
A <unk> had come upon him at times .
From the moment of the scene with Nikolay at Porfiry ’ s he had been <unk> , <unk> in without hope of escape .
After Nikolay ’ s confession , on that very day had come the scene with Sonia ; his behaviour and his last words had been utterly unlike anything he could have imagined beforehand ; he had grown <unk> , instantly and <unk> !
And he had agreed at the time with Sonia , he had agreed in his heart he could not go on living alone with such a thing on his mind !
“ And Svidrigaïlov was a <unk> ...
He worried him , that was true , but somehow not on the same point .
He might still have a struggle to come with Svidrigaïlov .
Svidrigaïlov , too , might be a means of escape ; but Porfiry was a different matter .
“ And so Porfiry himself had explained it to Razumihin , had explained it _ psychologically _ .
He had begun bringing in his damned psychology again !
Porfiry ?
But to think that Porfiry should for one moment believe that Nikolay was guilty , after what had passed between them before Nikolay ’ s appearance , after that <unk> interview , which could have only _ one _ explanation ?
( During those days Raskolnikov had often recalled <unk> in that scene with Porfiry ; he could not bear to let his mind rest on it . )
Such words , such gestures had passed between them , they had exchanged such glances , things had been said in such a tone and had reached such a pass , that Nikolay , whom Porfiry had seen through at the first word , at the first gesture , could not have shaken his conviction .
“ And to think that even Razumihin had begun to suspect !
The scene in the corridor under the lamp had produced its effect then .
He had rushed to Porfiry ....
But what had induced the latter to receive him like that ?
What had been his object in putting Razumihin off with Nikolay ?
He must have some plan ; there was some design , but what was it ?
It was true that a long time had passed since that <unk> long a <unk> no sight nor sound of Porfiry .
Well , that was a bad sign .... ” Raskolnikov took his cap and went out of the room , still pondering .
It was the first time for a long while that he had felt clear in his mind , at least .
“ I must settle Svidrigaïlov , ” he thought , “ and as soon as possible ; he , too , seems to be waiting for me to come to him of my own accord . ” And at that moment there was such a rush of hate in his weary heart that he might have killed either of those <unk> or Svidrigaïlov .
At least he felt that he would be capable of doing it later , if not now .
“ We shall see , we shall see , ” he repeated to himself .
But no sooner had he opened the door than he stumbled upon Porfiry himself in the passage .
He was coming in to see him .
Raskolnikov was <unk> for a minute , but only for one minute .
Strange to say , he was not very much astonished at seeing Porfiry and scarcely afraid of him .
He was simply startled , but was quickly , instantly , on his guard .
“ Perhaps this will mean the end ?
But how could Porfiry have approached so quietly , like a cat , so that he had heard nothing ?
Could he have been listening at the door ? ” “ You didn ’ t expect a visitor , Rodion Romanovitch , ” Porfiry explained , laughing .
“ I ’ ve been meaning to look in a long time ; I was passing by and thought why not go in for five minutes .
Are you going out ?
I won ’ t keep you long .
Just let me have one cigarette . ” “ Sit down , Porfiry Petrovitch , sit down . ” Raskolnikov gave his visitor a seat with so pleased and friendly an expression that he would have marvelled at himself , if he could have seen it .
The last moment had come , the last drops had to be <unk> !
So a man will sometimes go through half an hour of <unk> terror with a <unk> , yet when the <unk> is at his throat at last , he feels no fear .
Raskolnikov seated himself directly facing Porfiry , and looked at him without <unk> .
Porfiry screwed up his eyes and began lighting a cigarette .
“ Speak , speak , ” seemed as though it would burst from Raskolnikov ’ s heart .
“ Come , why don ’ t you speak ? ” CHAPTER II “ Ah these cigarettes ! ” Porfiry Petrovitch ejaculated at last , having lighted one .
“ They are <unk> , positively <unk> , and yet I can ’ t give them up !
I cough , I begin to have <unk> in my throat and a difficulty in breathing .
You know I am a coward , I went lately to <unk> <unk> ; he always gives at least half an hour to each patient .
He positively laughed looking at me ; he sounded me : ‘ <unk> ’ s bad for you , ’ he said , ‘ your <unk> are affected . ’ But how am I to give it up ?
What is there to take its place ?
I don ’ t drink , that ’ s the mischief , he-he-he , that I don ’ t .
Everything is relative , Rodion Romanovitch , everything is relative ! ” “ Why , he ’ s playing his <unk> tricks again , ” Raskolnikov thought with disgust .
All the circumstances of their last interview suddenly came back to him , and he felt a rush of the feeling that had come upon him then .
“ I came to see you the day before yesterday , in the evening ; you didn ’ t know ? ” Porfiry Petrovitch went on , looking round the room .
“ I came into this very room .
I was passing by , just as I did to-day , and I thought I ’ d return your call .
I walked in as your door was wide open , I looked round , waited and went out without leaving my name with your servant .
Don ’ t you lock your door ? ” Raskolnikov ’ s face grew more and more gloomy .
Porfiry seemed to guess his state of mind .
“ I ’ ve come to have it out with you , Rodion Romanovitch , my dear fellow !
I owe you an explanation and must give it to you , ” he continued with a slight smile , just <unk> Raskolnikov ’ s knee .
But almost at the same instant a serious and <unk> look came into his face ; to his surprise Raskolnikov saw a touch of <unk> in it .
He had never seen and never suspected such an expression in his face .
“ A strange scene passed between us last time we met , Rodion Romanovitch .
Our first interview , too , was a strange one ; but then ... and one thing after another !
This is the point : I have perhaps acted <unk> to you ; I feel it .
Do you remember how we parted ?
Your nerves were unhinged and your knees were shaking and so were mine .
And , you know , our behaviour was unseemly , even ungentlemanly .
And yet we are gentlemen , above all , in any case , gentlemen ; that must be understood .
Do you remember what we came to ? ...
and it was quite <unk> . ” “ What is he up to , what does he take me for ? ” Raskolnikov asked himself in amazement , raising his head and looking with open eyes on Porfiry .
“ I ’ ve decided <unk> is better between us , ” Porfiry Petrovitch went on , turning his head away and dropping his eyes , as though unwilling to <unk> his former victim and as though <unk> his former <unk> .
“ Yes , such suspicions and such scenes cannot <unk> for long .
Nikolay put a stop to it , or I don ’ t know what we might not have come to .
That damned workman was sitting at the time in the next <unk> you realise that ?
You know that , of course ; and I am aware that he came to you afterwards .
But what you supposed then was not true : I had not sent for anyone , I had made no kind of arrangements .
You ask why I hadn ’ t ?
What shall I say to you ?
it had all come upon me so suddenly .
I had scarcely sent for the porters ( you noticed them as you went out , I dare say ) .
An idea flashed upon me ; I was firmly convinced at the time , you see , Rodion Romanovitch .
Come , I <unk> if I let one thing slip for a time , I shall get hold of something <unk> shan ’ t lose what I want , anyway .
You are nervously irritable , Rodion Romanovitch , by temperament ; it ’ s out of <unk> with other qualities of your heart and character , which I <unk> myself I have to some extent <unk> .
Of course I did reflect even then that it does not always happen that a man gets up and <unk> out his whole story .
It does happen sometimes , if you make a man lose all patience , though even then it ’ s rare .
I was capable of realising that .
If I only had a fact , I thought , the least little fact to go upon , something I could lay hold of , something <unk> , not merely psychological .
For if a man is guilty , you must be able to get something <unk> out of him ; one may reckon upon most surprising <unk> indeed .
I was reckoning on your temperament , Rodion Romanovitch , on your temperament above all things !
I had great hopes of you at that time . ” “ But what are you driving at now ? ” Raskolnikov muttered at last , asking the question without thinking .
“ What is he talking about ? ” he wondered <unk> , “ does he really take me to be innocent ? ” “ What am I driving at ?
I ’ ve come to explain myself , I consider it my duty , so to speak .
I want to make clear to you how the whole business , the whole misunderstanding arose .
I ’ ve caused you a great deal of suffering , Rodion Romanovitch .
I am not a monster .
I understand what it must mean for a man who has been unfortunate , but who is proud , <unk> and above all , impatient , to have to bear such treatment !
I regard you in any case as a man of noble character and not without <unk> of <unk> , though I don ’ t agree with all your convictions .
I wanted to tell you this first , frankly and quite sincerely , for above all I don ’ t want to deceive you .
When I made your acquaintance , I felt attracted by you .
Perhaps you will laugh at my saying so .
You have a right to .
I know you disliked me from the first and indeed you ’ ve no reason to like me .
You may think what you like , but I desire now to do all I can to <unk> that impression and to show that I am a man of heart and conscience .
I speak sincerely . ” Porfiry Petrovitch made a dignified pause .
Raskolnikov felt a rush of renewed alarm .
The thought that Porfiry believed him to be innocent began to make him uneasy .
“ It ’ s scarcely necessary to go over everything in detail , ” Porfiry Petrovitch went on .
“ Indeed , I could scarcely attempt it .
To begin with there were rumours .
Through whom , how , and when those rumours came to me ... and how they affected you , I need not go into .
My suspicions were aroused by a complete accident , which might just as easily not have happened .
What was it ?
Hm !
I believe there is no need to go into that either .
Those rumours and that accident led to one idea in my mind .
I admit it <unk> one may as well make a clean breast of <unk> was the first to pitch on you .
The old woman ’ s notes on the pledges and the rest of <unk> all came to nothing .
Yours was one of a hundred .
I happened , too , to hear of the scene at the office , from a man who described it <unk> , unconsciously <unk> the scene with great vividness .
It was just one thing after another , Rodion Romanovitch , my dear fellow !
How could I avoid being brought to certain ideas ?
From a hundred <unk> you can ’ t make a horse , a hundred suspicions don ’ t make a proof , as the English <unk> says , but that ’ s only from the rational point of <unk> can ’ t help being <unk> , for after all a lawyer is only human .
I thought , too , of your article in that <unk> , do you remember , on your first visit we talked of it ?
I jeered at you at the time , but that was only to lead you on .
I repeat , Rodion Romanovitch , you are ill and impatient .
That you were bold , <unk> , in earnest and ... had felt a great deal I recognised long before .
I , too , have felt the same , so that your article seemed familiar to me .
It was conceived on <unk> nights , with a throbbing heart , in ecstasy and suppressed enthusiasm .
And that proud suppressed enthusiasm in young people is dangerous !
I jeered at you then , but let me tell you that , as a literary <unk> , I am awfully fond of such first <unk> , full of the heat of youth .
There is a <unk> and a <unk> <unk> in the mist .
Your article is absurd and fantastic , but there ’ s a transparent <unk> , a youthful <unk> pride and the daring of despair in it .
It ’ s a gloomy article , but that ’ s what ’ s fine in it .
I read your article and put it aside , thinking as I did so ‘ that man won ’ t go the common way . ’ Well , I ask you , after that as a preliminary , how could I help being carried away by what followed ?
Oh , dear , I am not saying anything , I am not making any statement now .
I simply noted it at the time .
What is there in it ?
I reflected .
There ’ s nothing in it , that is really nothing and perhaps absolutely nothing .
And it ’ s not at all the thing for the <unk> to let himself be carried away by <unk> : here I have Nikolay on my hands with actual evidence against <unk> may think what you like of it , but it ’ s evidence .
He brings in his psychology , too ; one has to consider him , too , for it ’ s a matter of life and death .
Why am I explaining this to you ?
That you may understand , and not blame my malicious behaviour on that occasion .
It was not malicious , I assure you , he-he !
Do you suppose I didn ’ t come to search your room at the time ?
I did , I did , he-he !
I was here when you were lying ill in bed , not officially , not in my own person , but I was here .
Your room was searched to the last thread at the first suspicion ; but _ <unk> _ !
I thought to myself , now that man will come , will come of himself and quickly , too ; if he ’ s guilty , he ’ s sure to come .
Another man wouldn ’ t , but he will .
And you remember how Mr. Razumihin began discussing the subject with you ?
We arranged that to excite you , so we purposely spread rumours , that he might discuss the case with you , and Razumihin is not a man to restrain his indignation .
Mr. Zametov was tremendously struck by your anger and your open daring .
Think of <unk> out in a restaurant ‘ I killed her . ’ It was too daring , too <unk> .
I thought so myself , if he is guilty he will be a <unk> <unk> .
That was what I thought at the time .
I was expecting you .
But you simply <unk> Zametov over and ... well , you see , it all lies in <unk> this <unk> psychology can be taken two ways !
Well , I kept expecting you , and so it was , you came !
My heart was fairly throbbing .
Ach !
“ Now , why need you have come ?
Your laughter , too , as you came in , do you remember ?
I saw it all plain as daylight , but if I hadn ’ t expected you so <unk> , I should not have noticed anything in your laughter .
You see what influence a mood has !
Mr. Razumihin <unk> , that stone , that stone under which the things were hidden !
I seem to see it somewhere in a kitchen garden .
It was in a kitchen garden , you told Zametov and afterwards you repeated that in my office ?
And when we began picking your article to pieces , how you explained it !
One could take every word of yours in two senses , as though there were another meaning hidden .
“ So in this way , Rodion Romanovitch , I reached the furthest limit , and knocking my head against a post , I pulled myself up , asking myself what I was about .
After all , I said , you can take it all in another sense if you like , and it ’ s more natural so , indeed .
I couldn ’ t help admitting it was more natural .
I was <unk> !
‘ No , I ’ d better get hold of some little fact ’ I said .
So when I heard of the bell-ringing , I held my breath and was all in a tremor .
‘ Here is my little fact , ’ thought I , and I didn ’ t think it over , I simply wouldn ’ t .
I would have given a thousand roubles at that minute to have seen you with my own eyes , when you walked a hundred paces beside that workman , after he had called you murderer to your face , and you did not dare to ask him a question all the way .
And then what about your trembling , what about your bell-ringing in your illness , in <unk> ?
“ And so , Rodion Romanovitch , can you wonder that I played such pranks on you ?
And what made you come at that very minute ?
Someone seemed to have sent you , by Jove !
And if Nikolay had not parted us ... and do you remember Nikolay at the time ?
Do you remember him clearly ?
It was a thunderbolt , a regular thunderbolt !
And how I met him !
I didn ’ t believe in the thunderbolt , not for a minute .
You could see it for yourself ; and how could I ?
Even afterwards , when you had gone and he began making very , very <unk> answers on certain points , so that I was surprised at him myself , even then I didn ’ t believe his story !
You see what it is to be as firm as a rock !
No , thought I , _ <unk> _ .
What has Nikolay got to do with it ! ” “ Razumihin told me just now that you think Nikolay guilty and had yourself assured him of it .... ” His voice failed him , and he broke off .
He had been listening in indescribable agitation , as this man who had seen through and through him , went back upon himself .
He was afraid of believing it and did not believe it .
In those still ambiguous words he kept eagerly looking for something more definite and conclusive .
“ Mr.
Razumihin ! ” cried Porfiry Petrovitch , seeming glad of a question from Raskolnikov , who had till then been silent .
“ He-he-he !
But I had to put Mr. Razumihin off ; two is company , three is none .
Mr. Razumihin is not the right man , besides he is an <unk> .
He came running to me with a pale face ....
But never mind him , why bring him in ?
To return to Nikolay , would you like to know what sort of a <unk> he is , how I understand him , that is ?
To begin with , he is still a child and not exactly a coward , but something by way of an artist .
Really , don ’ t laugh at my describing him so .
He is innocent and <unk> to influence .
He has a heart , and is a fantastic fellow .
He <unk> and <unk> , he tells stories , they say , so that people come from other <unk> to hear him .
He <unk> school too , and <unk> till he cries if you hold up a finger to him ; he will drink himself <unk> as a regular vice , but at times , when people treat him , like a child .
And he stole , too , then , without knowing it himself , for ‘ How can it be stealing , if one <unk> it up ? ’ And do you know he is an <unk> <unk> , or rather a <unk> ?
There have been <unk> &#91; * &#93; in his family , and he was for two years in his <unk> under the <unk> <unk> of a certain elder .
I learnt all this from Nikolay and from his fellow <unk> .
And what ’ s more , he wanted to run into the <unk> !
He was full of <unk> , prayed at night , read the old books , ‘ the true ’ ones , and read himself crazy .
&#91; * &#93; A religious <unk> ’ S <unk> .
“ Petersburg had a great effect upon him , especially the women and the wine .
He <unk> to everything and he forgot the elder and all that .
I learnt that an artist here took a fancy to him , and used to go and see him , and now this business came upon him .
“ Well , he was frightened , he tried to hang himself !
He ran away !
How can one get over the idea the people have of Russian legal <unk> ?
The very word ‘ trial ’ frightens some of them .
<unk> fault is it ?
We shall see what the new <unk> will do .
God grant they do good !
Well , in prison , it seems , he remembered the <unk> elder ; the <unk> , too , made its appearance again .
Do you know , Rodion Romanovitch , the force of the word ‘ suffering ’ among some of these people !
It ’ s not a question of suffering for someone ’ s benefit , but simply , ‘ one must suffer . ’ If they suffer at the hands of the <unk> , so much the better .
In my time there was a very meek and <unk> prisoner who spent a whole year in prison always reading his <unk> on the stove at night and he read himself crazy , and so crazy , do you know , that one day , apropos of nothing , he seized a brick and flung it at the governor ; though he had done him no harm .
And the way he threw it too : aimed it a yard on one side on purpose , for fear of <unk> him .
Well , we know what happens to a prisoner who <unk> an officer with a weapon .
So ‘ he took his suffering . ’ “ So I suspect now that Nikolay wants to take his suffering or something of the sort .
I know it for certain from facts , indeed .
Only he doesn ’ t know that I know .
What , you don ’ t admit that there are such fantastic people among the peasants ?
<unk> of them .
The elder now has begun <unk> him , especially since he tried to hang himself .
But he ’ ll come and tell me all himself .
You think he ’ ll hold out ?
Wait a bit , he ’ ll take his words back .
I am waiting from hour to hour for him to come and <unk> his evidence .
I have come to like that Nikolay and am studying him in detail .
And what do you think ?
He-he !
He answered me very <unk> on some points , he obviously had collected some evidence and prepared himself cleverly .
But on other points he is simply at <unk> , knows nothing and doesn ’ t even suspect that he doesn ’ t know !
“ No , Rodion Romanovitch , Nikolay doesn ’ t come in !
This is a fantastic , gloomy business , a modern case , an incident of to-day when the heart of man is troubled , when the phrase is <unk> that blood ‘ <unk> , ’ when comfort is <unk> as the aim of life .
Here we have <unk> dreams , a heart unhinged by theories .
Here we see resolution in the first stage , but resolution of a special kind : he resolved to do it like jumping over a <unk> or from a bell tower and his legs shook as he went to the crime .
He forgot to shut the door after him , and murdered two people for a theory .
He committed the murder and couldn ’ t take the money , and what he did manage to snatch up he hid under a stone .
It wasn ’ t enough for him to suffer agony behind the door while they battered at the door and <unk> the bell , no , he had to go to the empty lodging , half delirious , to recall the bell-ringing , he wanted to feel the cold shiver over again .... Well , that we grant , was through illness , but consider this : he is a murderer , but looks upon himself as an honest man , <unk> others , <unk> as injured innocence .
No , that ’ s not the work of a Nikolay , my dear Rodion Romanovitch ! ” All that had been said before had sounded so like a <unk> that these words were too great a shock .
Raskolnikov shuddered as though he had been stabbed .
“ Then ... who then ... is the murderer ? ” he asked in a breathless voice , unable to restrain himself .
Porfiry Petrovitch sank back in his chair , as though he were amazed at the question .
“ Who is the murderer ? ” he repeated , as though unable to believe his ears .
“ Why , _ you _ , Rodion Romanovitch !
You are the murderer , ” he added , almost in a whisper , in a voice of genuine conviction .
Raskolnikov leapt from the sofa , stood up for a few seconds and sat down again without uttering a word .
His face <unk> convulsively .
“ Your lip is twitching just as it did before , ” Porfiry Petrovitch observed almost <unk> .
“ You ’ ve been misunderstanding me , I think , Rodion Romanovitch , ” he added after a brief pause , “ that ’ s why you are so surprised .
I came on purpose to tell you everything and deal openly with you . ” “ It was not I murdered her , ” Raskolnikov whispered like a frightened child caught in the act .
“ No , it was you , you Rodion Romanovitch , and no one else , ” Porfiry whispered sternly , with conviction .
They were both silent and the silence lasted strangely long , about ten minutes .
Raskolnikov put his elbow on the table and passed his fingers through his hair .
Porfiry Petrovitch sat quietly waiting .
Suddenly Raskolnikov looked <unk> at Porfiry .
“ You are at your old tricks again , Porfiry Petrovitch !
Your old method again .
I wonder you don ’ t get sick of it ! ” “ Oh , stop that , what does that matter now ?
It would be a different matter if there were witnesses present , but we are whispering alone .
You see yourself that I have not come to <unk> and <unk> you like a <unk> .
Whether you confess it or not is nothing to me now ; for myself , I am convinced without it . ” “ If so , what did you come for ? ” Raskolnikov asked irritably .
“ I ask you the same question again : if you consider me guilty , why don ’ t you take me to prison ? ” “ Oh , that ’ s your question !
I will answer you , point for point .
In the first place , to arrest you so directly is not to my interest . ” “ How so ?
If you are convinced you ought .... ” “ Ach , what if I am convinced ?
That ’ s only my dream for the time .
Why should I put you in safety ?
You know that ’ s it , since you ask me to do it .
If I <unk> you with that workman for instance and you say to him ‘ were you drunk or not ?
Who saw me with you ?
I simply took you to be drunk , and you were drunk , too . ’ Well , what could I answer , especially as your story is a more likely one than his ?
for there ’ s nothing but psychology to support his <unk> ’ s almost unseemly with his ugly <unk> , while you hit the mark exactly , for the <unk> is an <unk> drunkard and <unk> so .
And I have myself admitted <unk> several times already that that psychology can be taken in two ways and that the second way is stronger and looks far more probable , and that apart from that I have as yet nothing against you .
And though I shall put you in prison and indeed have <unk> contrary to <unk> inform you of it beforehand , yet I tell you frankly , also contrary to <unk> , that it won ’ t be to my advantage .
Well , secondly , I ’ ve come to you because ... ” “ Yes , yes , secondly ? ” Raskolnikov was listening breathless .
“ Because , as I told you just now , I consider I owe you an explanation .
I don ’ t want you to look upon me as a monster , as I have a genuine liking for you , you may believe me or not .
And in the third place I ’ ve come to you with a direct and open <unk> you should <unk> and confess .
It will be infinitely more to your advantage and to my advantage too , for my task will be done .
Well , is this open on my part or not ? ” Raskolnikov thought a minute .
“ Listen , Porfiry Petrovitch .
You said just now you have nothing but psychology to go on , yet now you ’ ve gone on <unk> .
Well , what if you are mistaken yourself , now ? ” “ No , Rodion Romanovitch , I am not mistaken .
I have a little fact even then , Providence sent it me . ” “ What little fact ? ” “ I won ’ t tell you what , Rodion Romanovitch .
And in any case , I haven ’ t the right to put it off any longer , I must arrest you .
So think it over : it makes no difference to me _ now _ and so I speak only for your sake .
Believe me , it will be better , Rodion Romanovitch . ” Raskolnikov smiled <unk> .
“ That ’ s not simply ridiculous , it ’ s positively shameless .
Why , even if I were guilty , which I don ’ t admit , what reason should I have to confess , when you tell me yourself that I shall be in greater safety in prison ? ” “ Ah , Rodion Romanovitch , don ’ t put too much faith in words , perhaps prison will not be altogether a <unk> place .
That ’ s only theory and my theory , and what authority am I for you ?
Perhaps , too , even now I am hiding something from you ?
I can ’ t lay bare everything , he-he !
And how can you ask what advantage ?
Don ’ t you know how it would <unk> your sentence ?
You would be confessing at a moment when another man has taken the crime on himself and so has muddled the whole case .
<unk> that !
I swear before God that I will so arrange that your confession shall come as a complete surprise .
We will make a clean sweep of all these psychological points , of a suspicion against you , so that your crime will appear to have been something like an <unk> , for in truth it was an <unk> .
I am an honest man , Rodion Romanovitch , and will keep my word . ” Raskolnikov maintained a mournful silence and let his head sink dejectedly .
He pondered a long while and at last smiled again , but his smile was sad and gentle .
“ No ! ” he said , apparently <unk> all attempt to keep up appearances with Porfiry , “ it ’ s not worth it , I don ’ t care about <unk> the sentence ! ” “ That ’ s just what I was afraid of ! ” Porfiry cried warmly and , as it seemed , involuntarily .
“ That ’ s just what I feared , that you wouldn ’ t care about the <unk> of sentence . ” Raskolnikov looked <unk> and <unk> at him .
“ Ah , don ’ t <unk> life ! ” Porfiry went on .
“ You have a great deal of it still before you .
How can you say you don ’ t want a <unk> of sentence ?
You are an impatient fellow ! ” “ A great deal of what lies before me ? ” “ Of life .
What sort of prophet are you , do you know much about it ?
<unk> and ye shall find .
This may be God ’ s means for bringing you to Him .
And it ’ s not for ever , the bondage .... ” “ The time will be <unk> , ” laughed Raskolnikov .
“ Why , is it the <unk> disgrace you are afraid of ?
It may be that you are afraid of it without knowing it , because you are young !
But anyway _ you _ shouldn ’ t be afraid of giving yourself up and confessing . ” “ Ach , hang it ! ” Raskolnikov whispered with loathing and contempt , as though he did not want to speak aloud .
He got up again as though he meant to go away , but sat down again in evident despair .
“ Hang it , if you like !
You ’ ve lost faith and you think that I am <unk> flattering you ; but how long has your life been ?
How much do you understand ?
You made up a theory and then were ashamed that it broke down and turned out to be not at all original !
It turned out something base , that ’ s true , but you are not hopelessly base .
By no means so base !
At least you didn ’ t deceive yourself for long , you went straight to the furthest point at one bound .
How do I regard you ?
I regard you as one of those men who would stand and smile at their <unk> while he cuts their <unk> out , if only they have found faith or God .
Find it and you will live .
You have long needed a change of air .
<unk> , too , is a good thing .
<unk> !
Maybe Nikolay is right in wanting to suffer .
I know you don ’ t believe in <unk> don ’ t be <unk> ; fling yourself straight into life , without <unk> ; don ’ t be <unk> <unk> will bear you to the bank and set you <unk> on your feet again .
What bank ?
How can I tell ?
I only believe that you have long life before you .
I know that you take all my words now for a set speech prepared beforehand , but maybe you will remember them after .
They may be of use some time .
That ’ s why I speak .
It ’ s as well that you only killed the old woman .
If you ’ d invented another theory you might perhaps have done something a thousand times more hideous .
You ought to thank God , perhaps .
How do you know ?
Perhaps God is saving you for something .
But keep a good heart and have less fear !
Are you afraid of the great <unk> before you ?
No , it would be shameful to be afraid of it .
Since you have taken such a step , you must <unk> your heart .
There is justice in it .
You must fulfil the demands of justice .
I know that you don ’ t believe it , but indeed , life will bring you through .
You will live it down in time .
What you need now is fresh air , fresh air , fresh air ! ” Raskolnikov positively started .
“ But who are you ?
what prophet are you ?
From the height of what <unk> calm do you <unk> these words of wisdom ? ” “ Who am I ?
I am a man with nothing to hope for , that ’ s all .
A man perhaps of feeling and sympathy , maybe of some knowledge too , but my day is over .
But you are a different matter , there is life waiting for you .
Though , who knows ?
maybe your life , too , will pass off in smoke and come to nothing .
Come , what does it matter , that you will pass into another class of men ?
It ’ s not comfort you regret , with your heart !
What of it that perhaps no one will see you for so long ?
It ’ s not time , but yourself that will decide that .
Be the sun and all will see you .
The sun has before all to be the sun .
Why are you smiling again ?
At my being such a Schiller ?
I bet you ’ re <unk> that I am trying to get round you by flattery .
Well , perhaps I am , he-he-he !
Perhaps you ’ d better not believe my word , perhaps you ’ d better never believe it <unk> ’ m made that way , I confess it .
But let me add , you can judge for yourself , I think , how far I am a base sort of man and how far I am honest . ” “ When do you mean to arrest me ? ” “ Well , I can let you walk about another day or two .
Think it over , my dear fellow , and pray to God .
It ’ s more in your interest , believe me . ” “ And what if I run away ? ” asked Raskolnikov with a strange smile .
“ No , you won ’ t run away .
A peasant would run away , a fashionable <unk> would run away , the <unk> of another man ’ s thought , for you ’ ve only to show him the end of your little finger and he ’ ll be ready to believe in anything for the rest of his life .
But you ’ ve ceased to believe in your theory already , what will you run away with ?
And what would you do in hiding ?
It would be hateful and difficult for you , and what you need more than anything in life is a definite position , an atmosphere to suit you .
And what sort of atmosphere would you have ?
If you ran away , you ’ d come back to yourself .
_ You can ’ t get on without us . _ And if I put you in <unk> you ’ ve been there a month , or two , or <unk> my word , you ’ ll confess of yourself and perhaps to your own surprise .
You won ’ t know an hour beforehand that you are coming with a confession .
I am convinced that you will decide , ‘ to take your suffering . ’ You don ’ t believe my words now , but you ’ ll come to it of yourself .
For suffering , Rodion Romanovitch , is a great thing .
Never mind my having grown fat , I know all the same .
Don ’ t laugh at it , there ’ s an idea in suffering , Nikolay is right .
No , you won ’ t run away , Rodion Romanovitch . ” Raskolnikov got up and took his cap .
Porfiry Petrovitch also rose .
“ Are you going for a walk ?
The evening will be fine , if only we don ’ t have a storm .
Though it would be a good thing to <unk> the air . ” He , too , took his cap .
“ Porfiry Petrovitch , please don ’ t take up the notion that I have confessed to you to-day , ” Raskolnikov pronounced with sullen <unk> .
“ You ’ re a strange man and I have listened to you from simple curiosity .
But I have admitted nothing , remember that ! ” “ Oh , I know that , I ’ ll remember .
Look at him , he ’ s trembling !
Don ’ t be uneasy , my dear fellow , have it your own way .
<unk> about a bit , you won ’ t be able to walk too far .
If anything happens , I have one request to make of you , ” he added , dropping his voice .
“ It ’ s an awkward one , but important .
If anything were to happen ( though indeed I don ’ t believe in it and think you quite incapable of it ) , yet in case you were taken during these forty or fifty hours with the notion of putting an end to the business in some other way , in some fantastic <unk> hands on <unk> ( it ’ s an absurd proposition , but you must forgive me for it ) do leave a brief but precise note , only two lines , and mention the stone .
It will be more generous .
Come , till we meet !
Good thoughts and sound decisions to you ! ” Porfiry went out , stooping and avoiding looking at Raskolnikov .
The latter went to the window and waited with irritable impatience till he calculated that Porfiry had reached the street and moved away .
Then he too went hurriedly out of the room .
CHAPTER III He hurried to Svidrigaïlov ’ s .
What he had to hope from that man he did not know .
But that man had some hidden power over him .
Having once recognised this , he could not rest , and now the time had come .
On the way , one question particularly worried him : had Svidrigaïlov been to Porfiry ’ s ?
As far as he could judge , he would swear to it , that he had not .
He pondered again and again , went over Porfiry ’ s visit ; no , he hadn ’ t been , of course he hadn ’ t .
But if he had not been yet , would he go ?
Meanwhile , for the present he fancied he couldn ’ t .
Why ?
He could not have explained , but if he could , he would not have wasted much thought over it at the moment .
It all worried him and at the same time he could not attend to it .
Strange to say , none would have believed it perhaps , but he only felt a faint vague anxiety about his immediate future .
Another , much more important anxiety tormented <unk> concerned himself , but in a different , more vital way .
Moreover , he was conscious of immense moral fatigue , though his mind was working better that morning than it had done of late .
And was it worth while , after all that had happened , to <unk> with these new trivial difficulties ?
Was it worth while , for instance , to <unk> that Svidrigaïlov should not go to Porfiry ’ s ?
Was it worth while to <unk> , to ascertain the facts , to waste time over anyone like Svidrigaïlov ?
Oh , how sick he was of it all !
And yet he was hastening to Svidrigaïlov ; could he be expecting something _ new _ from him , information , or means of escape ?
Men will catch at <unk> !
Was it destiny or some <unk> bringing them together ?
Perhaps it was only fatigue , despair ; perhaps it was not Svidrigaïlov but some other whom he needed , and Svidrigaïlov had simply presented himself by chance .
Sonia ?
But what should he go to Sonia for now ?
To beg her tears again ?
He was afraid of Sonia , too .
Sonia stood before him as an <unk> sentence .
He must go his own way or hers .
At that moment especially he did not feel equal to seeing her .
No , would it not be better to try Svidrigaïlov ?
And he could not help inwardly <unk> that he had long felt that he must see him for some reason .
But what could they have in common ?
Their very <unk> could not be of the same kind .
The man , moreover , was very unpleasant , evidently depraved , <unk> cunning and <unk> , possibly malignant .
Such stories were told about him .
It is true he was <unk> Katerina Ivanovna ’ s children , but who could tell with what motive and what it meant ?
The man always had some design , some project .
There was another thought which had been continually <unk> of late about Raskolnikov ’ s mind , and <unk> him great uneasiness .
It was so painful that he made distinct efforts to get rid of it .
He sometimes thought that Svidrigaïlov was <unk> his footsteps .
Svidrigaïlov had found out his secret and had had designs on Dounia .
What if he had them still ?
Wasn ’ t it practically certain that he had ?
And what if , having learnt his secret and so having gained power over him , he were to use it as a weapon against Dounia ?
This idea sometimes even tormented his dreams , but it had never presented itself so vividly to him as on his way to Svidrigaïlov .
The very thought moved him to gloomy rage .
To begin with , this would <unk> everything , even his own position ; he would have at once to confess his secret to Dounia .
Would he have to give himself up perhaps to prevent Dounia from taking some <unk> step ?
The letter ?
This morning Dounia had received a letter .
From whom could she get letters in Petersburg ?
Luzhin , perhaps ?
It ’ s true Razumihin was there to protect her , but Razumihin knew nothing of the position .
Perhaps it was his duty to tell Razumihin ?
He thought of it with repugnance .
In any case he must see Svidrigaïlov as soon as possible , he decided finally .
Thank God , the details of the interview were of little consequence , if only he could get at the <unk> of the matter ; but if Svidrigaïlov were capable ... if he were <unk> against <unk> ... Raskolnikov was so exhausted by what he had passed through that month that he could only decide such questions in one way ; “ then I shall kill him , ” he thought in cold despair .
A sudden anguish <unk> his heart , he stood still in the middle of the street and began looking about to see where he was and which way he was going .
He found himself in X.
Prospect , thirty or forty paces from the Hay Market , through which he had come .
The whole second storey of the house on the left was used as a tavern .
All the windows were wide open ; judging from the figures moving at the windows , the rooms were full to <unk> .
There were sounds of singing , of <unk> and <unk> , and the <unk> of a <unk> drum .
He could hear women shrieking .
He was about to turn back wondering why he had come to the X.
Prospect , when suddenly at one of the end windows he saw Svidrigaïlov , sitting at a <unk> right in the open window with a pipe in his mouth .
Raskolnikov was dreadfully taken aback , almost terrified .
Svidrigaïlov was silently watching and scrutinising him and , what struck Raskolnikov at once , seemed to be meaning to get up and slip away <unk> .
Raskolnikov at once pretended not to have seen him , but to be looking <unk> away , while he watched him out of the corner of his eye .
His heart was beating violently .
Yet , it was evident that Svidrigaïlov did not want to be seen .
He took the pipe out of his mouth and was on the point of concealing himself , but as he got up and moved back his chair , he seemed to have become suddenly aware that Raskolnikov had seen him , and was watching him .
What had passed between them was much the same as what happened at their first meeting in Raskolnikov ’ s room .
A sly smile came into Svidrigaïlov ’ s face and grew broader and broader .
Each knew that he was seen and watched by the other .
At last Svidrigaïlov broke into a loud laugh .
“ Well , well , come in if you want me ; I am here ! ” he shouted from the window .
Raskolnikov went up into the tavern .
He found Svidrigaïlov in a tiny back room , <unk> the saloon in which <unk> , clerks and numbers of people of all sorts were drinking tea at twenty little tables to the desperate bawling of a chorus of singers .
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> could be heard in the distance .
On the table before Svidrigaïlov stood an open bottle and a glass half full of champagne .
In the room he found also a boy with a little hand organ , a <unk> <unk> girl of eighteen , wearing a <unk> <unk> skirt , and a <unk> hat with ribbons .
In spite of the chorus in the other room , she was singing some servants ’ <unk> song in a rather <unk> <unk> , to the <unk> of the organ .
“ Come , that ’ s enough , ” Svidrigaïlov stopped her at Raskolnikov ’ s entrance .
The girl at once broke off and stood waiting respectfully .
She had sung her <unk> <unk> , too , with a serious and respectful expression in her face .
“ Hey , Philip , a glass ! ” shouted Svidrigaïlov .
“ I won ’ t drink anything , ” said Raskolnikov .
“ As you like , I didn ’ t mean it for you .
Drink , Katia !
I don ’ t want anything more to-day , you can go . ” He <unk> her out a full glass , and laid down a yellow note .
Katia drank off her glass of wine , as women do , without putting it down , in twenty <unk> , took the note and kissed Svidrigaïlov ’ s hand , which he allowed quite seriously .
She went out of the room and the boy <unk> after her with the organ .
Both had been brought in from the street .
Svidrigaïlov had not been a week in Petersburg , but everything about him was already , so to speak , on a <unk> footing ; the waiter , Philip , was by now an old friend and very <unk> .
The door leading to the saloon had a lock on it .
Svidrigaïlov was at home in this room and perhaps spent whole days in it .
The tavern was dirty and wretched , not even <unk> .
“ I was going to see you and looking for you , ” Raskolnikov began , “ but I don ’ t know what made me turn from the Hay Market into the X.
Prospect just now .
I never take this turning .
I turn to the right from the Hay Market .
And this isn ’ t the way to you .
I simply turned and here you are .
It is strange ! ” “ Why don ’ t you say at once ‘ it ’ s a miracle ’ ? ” “ Because it may be only chance . ” “ Oh , that ’ s the way with all you <unk> , ” laughed Svidrigaïlov .
“ You won ’ t admit it , even if you do inwardly believe it a miracle !
Here you say that it may be only chance .
And what <unk> they all are here , about having an opinion of their own , you can ’ t fancy , Rodion Romanovitch .
I don ’ t mean you , you have an opinion of your own and are not afraid to have it .
That ’ s how it was you attracted my curiosity . ” “ Nothing else ? ” “ Well , that ’ s enough , you know , ” Svidrigaïlov was obviously exhilarated , but only slightly so , he had not had more than half a glass of wine .
“ I fancy you came to see me before you knew that I was capable of having what you call an opinion of my own , ” observed Raskolnikov .
“ Oh , well , it was a different matter .
Everyone has his own plans .
And apropos of the miracle let me tell you that I think you have been asleep for the last two or three days .
I told you of this tavern myself , there is no miracle in your coming straight here .
I explained the way myself , told you where it was , and the hours you could find me here .
Do you remember ? ” “ I don ’ t remember , ” answered Raskolnikov with surprise .
“ I believe you .
I told you twice .
The address has been <unk> mechanically on your memory .
You turned this way mechanically and yet precisely according to the direction , though you are not aware of it .
When I told you then , I hardly hoped you understood me .
You give yourself away too much , Rodion Romanovitch .
And another thing , I ’ m convinced there are lots of people in Petersburg who talk to themselves as they walk .
This is a town of crazy people .
If only we had scientific men , <unk> , lawyers and <unk> might make most valuable <unk> in Petersburg each in his own line .
There are few places where there are so many gloomy , strong and queer influences on the soul of man as in Petersburg .
The mere influences of <unk> mean so much .
And it ’ s the <unk> <unk> of all Russia and its character must be reflected on the whole country .
But that is neither here nor there now .
The point is that I have several times watched you .
You walk out of your <unk> your head <unk> paces from home you let it sink , and <unk> your hands behind your back .
You look and evidently see nothing before nor beside you .
At last you begin moving your lips and talking to yourself , and sometimes you wave one hand and <unk> , and at last stand still in the middle of the road .
That ’ s not at all the thing .
Someone may be watching you besides me , and it won ’ t do you any good .
It ’ s nothing really to do with me and I can ’ t cure you , but , of course , you understand me . ” “ Do you know that I am being followed ? ” asked Raskolnikov , looking inquisitively at him .
“ No , I know nothing about it , ” said Svidrigaïlov , seeming surprised .
“ Well , then , let us leave me alone , ” Raskolnikov muttered , frowning .
“ Very good , let us leave you alone . ” “ You had better tell me , if you come here to drink , and <unk> me twice to come here to you , why did you hide , and try to get away just now when I looked at the window from the street ?
I saw it . ” “ He-he !
And why was it you lay on your sofa with closed eyes and pretended to be asleep , though you were wide awake while I stood in your doorway ?
I saw it . ” “ I may have had ... reasons .
You know that yourself . ” “ And I may have had my reasons , though you don ’ t know them . ” Raskolnikov dropped his right elbow on the table , leaned his chin in the fingers of his right hand , and stared intently at Svidrigaïlov .
For a full minute he scrutinised his face , which had impressed him before .
It was a strange face , like a <unk> ; white and red , with bright red lips , with a flaxen beard , and still thick flaxen hair .
His eyes were somehow too blue and their expression somehow too heavy and fixed .
There was something awfully unpleasant in that handsome face , which looked so <unk> young for his age .
Svidrigaïlov was smartly dressed in light summer clothes and was particularly <unk> in his linen .
He wore a huge ring with a precious stone in it .
“ Have I got to bother myself about you , too , now ? ” said Raskolnikov suddenly , coming with nervous impatience straight to the point .
“ Even though perhaps you are the most dangerous man if you care to <unk> me , I don ’ t want to put myself out any more .
I will show you at once that I don ’ t <unk> myself as you probably think I do .
I ’ ve come to tell you at once that if you keep to your former intentions with regard to my sister and if you think to <unk> any benefit in that direction from what has been discovered of late , I will kill you before you get me locked up .
You can reckon on my word .
You know that I can keep it .
And in the second place if you want to tell me <unk> I keep fancying all this time that you have something to tell <unk> haste and tell it , for time is precious and very likely it will soon be too late . ” “ Why in such haste ? ” asked Svidrigaïlov , looking at him curiously .
“ Everyone has his plans , ” Raskolnikov answered gloomily and impatiently .
“ You <unk> me yourself to frankness just now , and at the first question you refuse to answer , ” Svidrigaïlov observed with a smile .
“ You keep fancying that I have aims of my own and so you look at me with suspicion .
Of course it ’ s perfectly natural in your position .
But though I should like to be friends with you , I shan ’ t trouble myself to convince you of the contrary .
The game isn ’ t worth the candle and I wasn ’ t intending to talk to you about anything special . ” “ What did you want me , for , then ?
It was you who came hanging about me . ” “ Why , simply as an interesting subject for observation .
I liked the fantastic nature of your <unk> ’ s what it was !
Besides you are the brother of a person who greatly interested me , and from that person I had in the past heard a very great deal about you , from which I gathered that you had a great influence over her ; isn ’ t that enough ?
Ha-ha-ha !
<unk> I must admit that your question is rather <unk> , and is difficult for me to answer .
Here , you , for instance , have come to me not only for a definite object , but for the sake of hearing something new .
Isn ’ t that so ?
Isn ’ t that so ? ” persisted Svidrigaïlov with a sly smile .
“ Well , can ’ t you fancy then that I , too , on my way here in the train was reckoning on you , on your telling me something new , and on my making some profit out of you !
You see what rich men we are ! ” “ What profit could you make ? ” “ How can I tell you ?
How do I know ?
You see in what a tavern I spend all my time and it ’ s my enjoyment , that ’ s to say it ’ s no great enjoyment , but one must sit somewhere ; that poor Katia <unk> saw her ? ...
If only I had been a <unk> now , a <unk> <unk> , but you see I can eat this . ” He pointed to a little table in the corner where the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> and <unk> lay on a tin <unk> .
“ Have you <unk> , by the way ?
I ’ ve had something and want nothing more .
I don ’ t drink , for instance , at all .
Except for champagne I never touch anything , and not more than a glass of that all the evening , and even that is enough to make my head ache .
I ordered it just now to wind myself up , for I am just going off somewhere and you see me in a peculiar state of mind .
That was why I hid myself just now like a <unk> , for I was afraid you would hinder me .
But I believe , ” he pulled out his watch , “ I can spend an hour with you .
It ’ s half-past four now .
If only I ’ d been something , a landowner , a father , a <unk> officer , a <unk> , a <unk> ...
I am nothing , no <unk> , and sometimes I am positively bored .
I really thought you would tell me something new . ” “ But what are you , and why have you come here ? ” “ What am I ?
You know , a gentleman , I served for two years in the <unk> , then I knocked about here in Petersburg , then I married Marfa Petrovna and lived in the country .
There you have my <unk> ! ” “ You are a gambler , I believe ? ” “ No , a poor sort of gambler .
A <unk> a gambler . ” “ You have been a card-sharper then ? ” “ Yes , I ’ ve been a card-sharper too . ” “ Didn ’ t you get thrashed sometimes ? ” “ It did happen .
Why ? ” “ Why , you might have <unk> them ... altogether it must have been lively . ” “ I won ’ t contradict you , and besides I am no hand at <unk> .
I confess that I hastened here for the sake of the women . ” “ As soon as you buried Marfa Petrovna ? ” “ Quite so , ” Svidrigaïlov smiled with <unk> <unk> .
“ What of it ?
You seem to find something wrong in my speaking like that about women ? ” “ You ask whether I find anything wrong in vice ? ” “ <unk> !
Oh , that ’ s what you are after !
But I ’ ll answer you in order , first about women in general ; you know I am fond of talking .
Tell me , what should I restrain myself for ?
Why should I give up women , since I have a passion for them ?
It ’ s an occupation , anyway . ” “ So you hope for nothing here but vice ? ” “ Oh , very well , for vice then .
You insist on its being vice .
But anyway I like a direct question .
In this vice at least there is something permanent , <unk> indeed upon nature and not dependent on fantasy , something present in the blood like an <unk> <unk> , for ever setting one on fire and , maybe , not to be quickly <unk> , even with years .
You ’ ll agree it ’ s an occupation of a sort . ” “ That ’ s nothing to <unk> at , it ’ s a disease and a dangerous one . ” “ Oh , that ’ s what you think , is it !
I agree , that it is a disease like everything that <unk> <unk> .
And , of course , in this one must <unk> <unk> .
But in the first place , everybody does so in one way or another , and in the second place , of course , one ought to be moderate and <unk> , however mean it may be , but what am I to do ?
If I hadn ’ t this , I might have to shoot myself .
I am ready to admit that a decent man ought to put up with being bored , but yet ... ” “ And could you shoot yourself ? ” “ Oh , come ! ” Svidrigaïlov <unk> with disgust .
“ Please don ’ t speak of it , ” he added hurriedly and with none of the bragging tone he had shown in all the previous conversation .
His face quite changed .
“ I admit it ’ s an unpardonable weakness , but I can ’ t help it .
I am afraid of death and I dislike its being talked of .
Do you know that I am to a certain extent a <unk> ? ” “ Ah , the <unk> of Marfa Petrovna !
Do they still go on visiting you ? ” “ Oh , don ’ t talk of them ; there have been no more in Petersburg , confound them ! ” he cried with an air of irritation .
“ Let ’ s rather talk of that ... though ... H ’ m !
I have not much time , and can ’ t stay long with you , it ’ s a pity !
I should have found plenty to tell you . ” “ What ’ s your <unk> , a woman ? ” “ Yes , a woman , a <unk> incident .... No , that ’ s not what I want to talk of . ” “ And the <unk> , the filthiness of all your surroundings , doesn ’ t that affect you ?
Have you lost the strength to stop yourself ? ” “ And do you <unk> to strength , too ?
He-he-he !
You surprised me just now , Rodion Romanovitch , though I knew beforehand it would be so .
You <unk> to me about vice and <unk> !
<unk> Schiller , <unk> <unk> !
Of course that ’ s all as it should be and it would be surprising if it were not so , yet it is strange in reality .... Ah , what a pity I have no time , for you ’ re a most interesting <unk> !
And , <unk> , are you fond of Schiller ?
I am awfully fond of him . ” “ But what a braggart you are , ” Raskolnikov said with some disgust .
“ Upon my word , I am not , ” answered Svidrigaïlov laughing .
“ However , I won ’ t dispute it , let me be a braggart , why not <unk> , if it hurts no one ?
I spent seven years in the country with Marfa Petrovna , so now when I come across an intelligent person like <unk> and highly <unk> am simply glad to talk and , besides , I ’ ve drunk that <unk> of champagne and it ’ s gone to my head a little .
And besides , there ’ s a certain fact that has wound me up tremendously , but about that I ... will keep quiet .
Where are you off to ? ” he asked in alarm .
Raskolnikov had begun getting up .
He felt <unk> and stifled and , as it were , ill at ease at having come here .
He felt convinced that Svidrigaïlov was the most worthless scoundrel on the face of the earth .
“ A-ach !
Sit down , stay a little ! ” Svidrigaïlov begged .
“ Let them bring you some tea , anyway .
Stay a little , I won ’ t talk nonsense , about myself , I mean .
I ’ ll tell you something .
If you like I ’ ll tell you how a woman tried ‘ to save ’ me , as you would call it ?
It will be an answer to your first question indeed , for the woman was your sister .
May I tell you ?
It will help to spend the time . ” “ Tell me , but I trust that you ... ” “ Oh , don ’ t be uneasy .
Besides , even in a worthless low fellow like me , Avdotya Romanovna can only excite the deepest respect . ” CHAPTER IV “ You know <unk> , I told you myself , ” began Svidrigaïlov , “ that I was in the <unk> ’ prison here , for an immense sum , and had not any expectation of being able to pay it .
There ’ s no need to go into <unk> how Marfa Petrovna bought me out ; do you know to what a point of insanity a woman can sometimes love ?
She was an honest woman , and very sensible , although completely uneducated .
Would you believe that this honest and jealous woman , after many scenes of <unk> and reproaches , <unk> to enter into a kind of contract with me which she kept <unk> our married life ?
She was <unk> older than I , and besides , she always kept a <unk> or something in her mouth .
There was so much <unk> in my soul and honesty too , of a sort , as to tell her straight out that I couldn ’ t be absolutely faithful to her .
This confession drove her to frenzy , but yet she seems in a way to have liked my brutal frankness .
She thought it showed I was unwilling to deceive her if I <unk> her like this beforehand and for a jealous woman , you know , that ’ s the first consideration .
After many tears an <unk> contract was drawn up between us : first , that I would never leave Marfa Petrovna and would always be her husband ; secondly , that I would never absent myself without her permission ; thirdly , that I would never set up a permanent mistress ; <unk> , in return for this , Marfa Petrovna gave me a free hand with the <unk> , but only with her secret knowledge ; <unk> , God <unk> my falling in love with a woman of our class ; <unk> , in case <unk> God <unk> be visited by a great serious passion I was bound to <unk> it to Marfa Petrovna .
On this last score , however , Marfa Petrovna was fairly at ease .
She was a sensible woman and so she could not help looking upon me as a <unk> <unk> incapable of real love .
But a sensible woman and a jealous woman are two very different things , and that ’ s where the trouble came in .
But to judge some people impartially we must <unk> certain <unk> opinions and our habitual attitude to the ordinary people about us .
I have reason to have faith in your judgment rather than in anyone ’ s .
Perhaps you have already heard a great deal that was ridiculous and absurd about Marfa Petrovna .
She certainly had some very ridiculous ways , but I tell you frankly that I feel really sorry for the innumerable <unk> of which I was the cause .
Well , and that ’ s enough , I think , by way of a <unk> _ <unk> <unk> _ for the most tender wife of a most tender husband .
When we quarrelled , I usually held my tongue and did not irritate her and that gentlemanly conduct rarely failed to attain its object , it <unk> her , it pleased her , indeed .
These were times when she was positively proud of me .
But your sister she couldn ’ t put up with , anyway .
And however she came to risk taking such a beautiful creature into her house as a governess .
My explanation is that Marfa Petrovna was an <unk> and <unk> woman and simply fell in love <unk> fell in <unk> your sister .
Well , little <unk> at Avdotya Romanovna !
I saw the danger at the first glance and what do you think , I resolved not to look at her even .
But Avdotya Romanovna herself made the first step , would you believe it ?
Would you believe it too that Marfa Petrovna was positively angry with me at first for my persistent silence about your sister , for my careless <unk> of her continual adoring praises of Avdotya Romanovna .
I don ’ t know what it was she wanted !
Well , of course , Marfa Petrovna told Avdotya Romanovna every detail about me .
She had the unfortunate habit of telling literally everyone all our family secrets and continually complaining of me ; how could she fail to <unk> in such a delightful new friend ?
I expect they talked of nothing else but me and no doubt Avdotya Romanovna heard all those dark mysterious rumours that were current about me ....
I don ’ t mind <unk> that you too have heard something of the sort already ? ” “ I have .
Luzhin <unk> you with having caused the death of a child .
Is that true ? ” “ Don ’ t <unk> to those vulgar <unk> , I beg , ” said Svidrigaïlov with disgust and annoyance .
“ If you insist on wanting to know about all that idiocy , I will tell you one day , but now ... ” “ I was told too about some <unk> of yours in the country whom you treated badly . ” “ I beg you to drop the subject , ” Svidrigaïlov interrupted again with obvious impatience .
“ Was that the <unk> who came to you after death to fill your pipe ? ...
you told me about it yourself . ” Raskolnikov felt more and more irritated .
Svidrigaïlov looked at him attentively and Raskolnikov fancied he caught a flash of spiteful mockery in that look .
But Svidrigaïlov restrained himself and answered very <unk> : “ Yes , it was .
I see that you , too , are extremely interested and shall feel it my duty to <unk> your curiosity at the first opportunity .
Upon my soul !
I see that I really might pass for a romantic figure with some people .
<unk> how grateful I must be to Marfa Petrovna for having repeated to Avdotya Romanovna such mysterious and interesting gossip about me .
I dare not guess what impression it made on her , but in any case it worked in my interests .
With all Avdotya Romanovna ’ s natural aversion and in spite of my invariably gloomy and <unk> <unk> did at least feel pity for me , pity for a lost soul .
And if once a girl ’ s heart is moved to _ pity _ , it ’ s more dangerous than anything .
She is bound to want to ‘ save him , ’ to bring him to his senses , and lift him up and draw him to <unk> aims , and restore him to new life and <unk> , we all know how far such dreams can go .
I saw at once that the bird was flying into the <unk> of herself .
And I too made ready .
I think you are frowning , Rodion Romanovitch ?
There ’ s no need .
As you know , it all ended in smoke .
( Hang it all , what a lot I am drinking ! )
Do you know , I always , from the very beginning , <unk> that it wasn ’ t your sister ’ s fate to be born in the second or third <unk> <unk> , as the daughter of a <unk> <unk> or some governor or <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
She would <unk> have been one of those who would endure <unk> and would have smiled when they branded her bosom with hot <unk> .
And she would have gone to it of herself .
And in the fourth or fifth <unk> she would have walked away into the Egyptian desert and would have stayed there thirty years living on <unk> and <unk> and visions .
She is simply <unk> to face some torture for someone , and if she can ’ t get her torture , she ’ ll throw herself out of a window .
I ’ ve heard something of a Mr. <unk> ’ s said to be a sensible fellow ; his <unk> <unk> it , indeed .
He ’ s probably a <unk> student .
Well , he ’ d better look after your sister !
I believe I understand her , and I am proud of it .
But at the beginning of an acquaintance , as you know , one is apt to be more <unk> and stupid .
One doesn ’ t see clearly .
Hang it all , why is she so handsome ?
It ’ s not my fault .
In fact , it began on my side with a most <unk> physical desire .
Avdotya Romanovna is awfully chaste , incredibly and <unk> so .
Take note , I tell you this about your sister as a fact .
She is almost <unk> chaste , in spite of her broad intelligence , and it will stand in her way .
There happened to be a girl in the house then , Parasha , a <unk> wench , whom I had never seen <unk> had just come from another <unk> pretty , but incredibly stupid : she burst into tears , wailed so that she could be heard all over the place and caused scandal .
One day after dinner Avdotya Romanovna followed me into an <unk> in the garden and with flashing eyes _ insisted _ on my leaving poor Parasha alone .
It was almost our first conversation by ourselves .
I , of course , was only too pleased to obey her <unk> , tried to appear disconcerted , embarrassed , in fact played my part not badly .
Then came interviews , mysterious conversations , <unk> , entreaties , <unk> , even <unk> you believe it , even tears ?
Think what the passion for propaganda will bring some girls to !
I , of course , threw it all on my destiny , <unk> as <unk> and <unk> for light , and finally <unk> to the most powerful weapon in the <unk> of the female heart , a weapon which never fails one .
It ’ s the <unk> <unk> .
Nothing in the world is <unk> than speaking the truth and nothing easier than flattery .
If there ’ s the hundredth part of a false note in speaking the truth , it leads to a <unk> , and that leads to trouble .
But if all , to the last note , is false in flattery , it is just as agreeable , and is heard not without satisfaction .
It may be a coarse satisfaction , but still a satisfaction .
And however coarse the flattery , at least half will be sure to seem true .
That ’ s so for all <unk> of development and classes of society .
A <unk> <unk> might be <unk> by flattery .
I can never remember without laughter how I once <unk> a lady who was devoted to her husband , her children , and her principles .
What fun it was and how little trouble !
And the lady really had <unk> her own , anyway .
All my <unk> lay in simply being utterly annihilated and <unk> before her purity .
I <unk> her <unk> , and as soon as I succeeded in getting a <unk> of the hand , even a glance from her , I would reproach myself for having snatched it by force , and would declare that she had <unk> , so that I could never have gained anything but for my being so <unk> .
I maintained that she was so innocent that she could not <unk> my <unk> , and <unk> to me unconsciously , <unk> , and so on .
In fact , I <unk> , while my lady remained firmly convinced that she was innocent , chaste , and faithful to all her duties and obligations and had <unk> quite by accident .
And how angry she was with me when I explained to her at last that it was my sincere conviction that she was just as eager as I.
Poor Marfa Petrovna was awfully weak on the side of flattery , and if I had only cared to , I might have had all her property settled on me during her <unk> .
( I am drinking an awful lot of wine now and talking too much . )
I hope you won ’ t be angry if I mention now that I was beginning to produce the same effect on Avdotya Romanovna .
But I was stupid and impatient and <unk> it all .
Avdotya Romanovna had several <unk> one time in <unk> greatly <unk> by the expression of my eyes , would you believe it ?
There was sometimes a light in them which frightened her and grew stronger and stronger and more <unk> till it was hateful to her .
No need to go into detail , but we parted .
There I acted stupidly again .
I fell to jeering in the <unk> way at all such propaganda and efforts to <unk> me ; Parasha came on to the scene again , and not she alone ; in fact there was a <unk> to-do .
Ah , Rodion Romanovitch , if you could only see how your sister ’ s eyes can flash sometimes !
Never mind my being drunk at this moment and having had a whole glass of wine .
I am speaking the truth .
I assure you that this glance has haunted my dreams ; the very rustle of her dress was more than I could stand at last .
I really began to think that I might become <unk> .
I could never have believed that I could be moved to such a frenzy .
It was essential , indeed , to be reconciled , but by then it was impossible .
And imagine what I did then !
To what a pitch of stupidity a man can be brought by frenzy !
Never undertake anything in a frenzy , Rodion Romanovitch .
I reflected that Avdotya Romanovna was after all a beggar ( ach , excuse me , that ’ s not the word ... but does it matter if it <unk> the meaning ?
) , that she lived by her work , that she had her mother and you to keep ( ach , hang it , you are frowning again ) , and I resolved to offer her all my <unk> thousand roubles I could have realised <unk> she would run away with me here , to Petersburg .
Of course I should have vowed eternal love , rapture , and so on .
Do you know , I was so wild about her at that time that if she had told me to poison Marfa Petrovna or to cut her throat and to marry herself , it would have been done at once !
But it ended in the <unk> of which you know already .
You can fancy how frantic I was when I heard that Marfa Petrovna had got hold of that <unk> <unk> , Luzhin , and had almost made a match between <unk> would really have been just the same thing as I was <unk> .
Wouldn ’ t it ?
Wouldn ’ t it ?
I notice that you ’ ve begun to be very attentive ... you interesting young man .... ” Svidrigaïlov struck the table with his fist impatiently .
He was flushed .
Raskolnikov saw clearly that the glass or glass and a half of champagne that he had <unk> almost unconsciously was affecting him--and he resolved to take advantage of the opportunity .
He felt very suspicious of Svidrigaïlov .
“ Well , after what you have said , I am fully convinced that you have come to Petersburg with designs on my sister , ” he said directly to Svidrigaïlov , in order to irritate him further .
“ Oh , nonsense , ” said Svidrigaïlov , seeming to rouse himself .
“ Why , I told you ... besides your sister can ’ t endure me . ” “ Yes , I am certain that she can ’ t , but that ’ s not the point . ” “ Are you so sure that she can ’ t ? ” Svidrigaïlov screwed up his eyes and smiled <unk> .
“ You are right , she doesn ’ t love me , but you can never be sure of what has passed between husband and wife or lover and mistress .
There ’ s always a little corner which remains a secret to the world and is only known to those two .
Will you answer for it that Avdotya Romanovna regarded me with aversion ? ” “ From some words you ’ ve dropped , I notice that you still have <unk> of course evil <unk> Dounia and mean to carry them out promptly . ” “ What , have I dropped words like that ? ” Svidrigaïlov asked in naïve dismay , taking not the slightest notice of the <unk> <unk> on his designs .
“ Why , you are dropping them even now .
Why are you so frightened ?
What are you so afraid of now ? ” “ <unk> ?
<unk> of you ?
You have rather to be afraid of me , _ <unk> <unk> _ .
But what nonsense .... I ’ ve drunk too much though , I see that .
I was almost saying too much again .
Damn the wine !
<unk> !
there , water ! ” He snatched up the champagne bottle and flung it without ceremony out of the window .
Philip brought the water .
“ That ’ s all nonsense ! ” said Svidrigaïlov , <unk> a towel and putting it to his head .
“ But I can answer you in one word and <unk> all your suspicions .
Do you know that I am going to get married ? ” “ You told me so before . ” “ Did I ?
I ’ ve forgotten .
But I couldn ’ t have told you so for certain for I had not even seen my betrothed ; I only meant to .
But now I really have a betrothed and it ’ s a settled thing , and if it weren ’ t that I have business that can ’ t be put off , I would have taken you to see them at once , for I should like to ask your advice .
Ach , hang it , only ten minutes left !
See , look at the watch .
But I must tell you , for it ’ s an interesting story , my marriage , in its own way .
Where are you off to ?
Going again ? ” “ No , I ’ m not going away now . ” “ Not at all ?
We shall see .
I ’ ll take you there , I ’ ll show you my betrothed , only not now .
For you ’ ll soon have to be off .
You have to go to the right and I to the left .
Do you know that Madame Resslich , the woman I am lodging with now , eh ?
I know what you ’ re thinking , that she ’ s the woman whose girl they say drowned herself in the winter .
Come , are you listening ?
She arranged it all for me .
You ’ re bored , she said , you want something to fill up your time .
For , you know , I am a gloomy , depressed person .
Do you think I ’ m <unk> ?
No , I ’ m gloomy .
I do no harm , but sit in a corner without speaking a word for three days at a time .
And that Resslich is a sly <unk> , I tell you .
I know what she has got in her mind ; she thinks I shall get sick of it , abandon my wife and <unk> , and she ’ ll get hold of her and make a profit out of <unk> our class , of course , or higher .
She told me the father was a <unk> retired official , who has been sitting in a chair for the last three years with his legs <unk> .
The mamma , she said , was a sensible woman .
There is a son <unk> in the provinces , but he doesn ’ t help ; there is a daughter , who is married , but she doesn ’ t visit them .
And they ’ ve two little <unk> on their hands , as though their own children were not enough , and they ’ ve taken from school their youngest daughter , a girl who ’ ll be sixteen in another month , so that then she can be married .
She was for me .
We went there .
How funny it was !
I present <unk> landowner , a widower , of a <unk> name , with connections , with a fortune .
What if I am fifty and she is not sixteen ?
Who thinks of that ?
But it ’ s fascinating , isn ’ t it ?
It is fascinating , ha-ha !
You should have seen how I talked to the papa and mamma .
It was worth paying to have seen me at that moment .
She comes in , <unk> , you can fancy , still in a short <unk> <unk> <unk> !
<unk> like a <unk> had been told , no doubt .
I don ’ t know how you feel about female faces , but to my mind these sixteen years , these childish eyes , shyness and tears of <unk> are better than beauty ; and she is a perfect little picture , too .
<unk> hair in little <unk> , like a <unk> ’ s , full little <unk> lips , tiny feet , a <unk> ! ...
Well , we made friends .
I told them I was in a hurry owing to <unk> circumstances , and the next day , that is the day before yesterday , we were betrothed .
When I go now I take her on my knee at once and keep her there .... Well , she <unk> like a sunset and I kiss her every minute .
Her mamma of course impresses on her that this is her husband and that this must be so .
It ’ s simply <unk> !
The present betrothed condition is perhaps better than marriage .
Here you have what is called _ la nature <unk> la <unk> _ , ha-ha !
I ’ ve talked to her twice , she is far from a fool .
Sometimes she <unk> a look at me that positively <unk> me .
Her face is like Raphael ’ s Madonna .
You know , the <unk> Madonna ’ s face has something fantastic in it , the face of mournful religious ecstasy .
Haven ’ t you noticed it ?
Well , she ’ s something in that line .
The day after we ’ d been betrothed , I bought her presents to the value of fifteen hundred <unk> set of <unk> and another of <unk> and a silver <unk> as large as this , with all sorts of things in it , so that even my Madonna ’ s face glowed .
I sat her on my knee , yesterday , and I suppose rather too <unk> flushed crimson and the tears started , but she didn ’ t want to show it .
We were left alone , she suddenly flung herself on my neck ( for the first time of her own accord ) , put her little arms round me , kissed me , and vowed that she would be an <unk> , faithful , and good wife , would make me happy , would devote all her life , every minute of her life , would sacrifice everything , everything , and that all she asks in return is my _ respect _ , and that she wants ‘ nothing , nothing more from me , no presents . ’ You ’ ll admit that to hear such a confession , alone , from an angel of sixteen in a muslin <unk> , with little <unk> , with a flush of <unk> shyness in her cheeks and tears of enthusiasm in her eyes is rather fascinating !
Isn ’ t it fascinating ?
It ’ s worth paying for , isn ’ t it ?
Well ... listen , we ’ ll go to see my betrothed , only not just now ! ” “ The fact is this monstrous difference in age and development <unk> your <unk> !
Will you really make such a marriage ? ” “ Why , of course .
Everyone thinks of himself , and he lives most gaily who knows best how to deceive himself .
Ha-ha !
But why are you so keen about virtue ?
Have mercy on me , my good friend .
I am a <unk> man .
Ha-ha-ha ! ” “ But you have provided for the children of Katerina Ivanovna .
Though ... though you had your own reasons ....
I understand it all now . ” “ I am always fond of children , very fond of them , ” laughed Svidrigaïlov .
“ I can tell you one curious instance of it .
The first day I came here I visited various <unk> , after seven years I simply rushed at them .
You probably notice that I am not in a hurry to <unk> acquaintance with my old friends .
I shall do without them as long as I can .
Do you know , when I was with Marfa Petrovna in the country , I was haunted by the thought of these places where anyone who knows his way about can find a great deal .
Yes , upon my soul !
The peasants have vodka , the educated young people , shut out from activity , waste themselves in impossible dreams and visions and are <unk> by theories ; Jews have sprung up and are <unk> money , and all the rest give themselves up to <unk> .
From the first hour the town <unk> of its familiar <unk> .
I chanced to be in a <unk> <unk> like my <unk> <unk> was a dance , so called , and there was a _ cancan _ such as I never saw in my day .
Yes , there you have progress .
All of a sudden I saw a little girl of <unk> , nicely dressed , dancing with a <unk> in that line , with another one _ <unk> _ .
Her mother was sitting on a chair by the wall .
You can ’ t fancy what a _ cancan _ that was !
The girl was ashamed , blushed , at last felt insulted , and began to cry .
Her partner seized her and began whirling her round and performing before her ; everyone laughed <unk> like your public , even the _ cancan _ <unk> laughed and shouted , ‘ <unk> her <unk> her right !
<unk> ’ t bring children ! ’ Well , it ’ s not my business whether that <unk> reflection was logical or not .
I at once fixed on my plan , sat down by the mother , and began by saying that I too was a stranger and that people here were <unk> and that they couldn ’ t distinguish decent folks and treat them with respect , gave her to understand that I had plenty of money , offered to take them home in my carriage .
I took them home and got to know them .
They were lodging in a miserable little hole and had only just arrived from the country .
She told me that she and her daughter could only regard my acquaintance as an honour .
I found out that they had nothing of their own and had come to town upon some legal business .
I <unk> my services and money .
I learnt that they had gone to the dancing saloon by mistake , believing that it was a genuine dancing class .
I offered to assist in the young girl ’ s education in French and dancing .
My offer was accepted with enthusiasm as an <unk> we are still friendly ....
If you like , we ’ ll go and see them , only not just now . ” “ Stop !
Enough of your vile , nasty <unk> , depraved vile , <unk> man ! ” “ Schiller , you are a regular Schiller !
_ O la <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ? _ But you know I shall tell you these things on purpose , for the pleasure of hearing your <unk> ! ” “ I dare say .
I can see I am ridiculous myself , ” muttered Raskolnikov angrily .
Svidrigaïlov laughed heartily ; finally he called Philip , paid his <unk> , and began getting up .
“ I say , but I am drunk , _ <unk> <unk> _ , ” he said .
“ It ’ s been a pleasure . ” “ I should rather think it must be a pleasure ! ” cried Raskolnikov , getting up .
“ No doubt it is a pleasure for a <unk> <unk> to describe such <unk> with a monstrous project of the same sort in his <unk> under such circumstances and to such a man as me .... It ’ s <unk> ! ” “ Well , if you come to that , ” Svidrigaïlov answered , scrutinising Raskolnikov with some surprise , “ if you come to that , you are a <unk> cynic yourself .
You ’ ve plenty to make you so , anyway .
You can understand a great deal ... and you can do a great deal too .
But enough .
I sincerely regret not having had more talk with you , but I shan ’ t lose sight of you .... Only wait a bit . ” Svidrigaïlov walked out of the restaurant .
Raskolnikov walked out after him .
Svidrigaïlov was not however very drunk , the wine had affected him for a moment , but it was passing off every minute .
He was preoccupied with something of importance and was frowning .
He was apparently excited and uneasy in anticipation of something .
His manner to Raskolnikov had changed during the last few minutes , and he was <unk> and more sneering every moment .
Raskolnikov noticed all this , and he too was uneasy .
He became very suspicious of Svidrigaïlov and resolved to follow him .
They came out on to the pavement .
“ You go to the right , and I to the left , or if you like , the other way .
Only _ <unk> , <unk> <unk> _ , may we meet again . ” And he walked to the right towards the Hay Market .
CHAPTER V Raskolnikov walked after him .
“ What ’ s this ? ” cried Svidrigaïlov turning round , “ I thought I said ... ” “ It means that I am not going to lose sight of you now . ” “ What ? ” Both stood still and gazed at one another , as though measuring their strength .
“ From all your half tipsy stories , ” Raskolnikov observed harshly , “ I am _ positive _ that you have not given up your designs on my sister , but are pursuing them more <unk> than ever .
I have learnt that my sister received a letter this morning .
You have hardly been able to sit still all this time .... You may have <unk> a wife on the way , but that means nothing .
I should like to make certain myself . ” Raskolnikov could hardly have said himself what he wanted and of what he wished to make certain .
“ Upon my word !
I ’ ll call the police ! ” “ Call away ! ” Again they stood for a minute facing each other .
At last Svidrigaïlov ’ s face changed .
Having satisfied himself that Raskolnikov was not frightened at his threat , he assumed a <unk> and friendly air .
“ What a fellow !
I purposely <unk> from <unk> to your affair , though I am <unk> by curiosity .
It ’ s a fantastic affair .
I ’ ve put it off till another time , but you ’ re enough to rouse the dead .... Well , let us go , only I warn you beforehand I am only going home for a moment , to get some money ; then I shall lock up the flat , take a cab and go to spend the evening at the Islands .
Now , now are you going to follow me ? ” “ I ’ m coming to your lodgings , not to see you but Sofya Semyonovna , to say I ’ m sorry not to have been at the funeral . ” “ That ’ s as you like , but Sofya Semyonovna is not at home .
She has taken the three children to an old lady of high rank , the <unk> of some orphan <unk> , whom I used to know years ago .
I <unk> the old lady by <unk> a sum of money with her to provide for the three children of Katerina Ivanovna and <unk> to the institution as well .
I told her too the story of Sofya Semyonovna in full detail , <unk> nothing .
It produced an indescribable effect on her .
That ’ s why Sofya Semyonovna has been invited to call to-day at the X.
<unk> where the lady is staying for the time . ” “ No matter , I ’ ll come all the same . ” “ As you like , it ’ s nothing to me , but I won ’ t come with you ; here we are at home .
By the way , I am convinced that you regard me with suspicion just because I have shown such delicacy and have not so far troubled you with questions ... you understand ?
It struck you as extraordinary ; I don ’ t mind <unk> it ’ s that .
Well , it <unk> one to show delicacy ! ” “ And to listen at doors ! ” “ Ah , that ’ s it , is it ? ” laughed Svidrigaïlov .
“ Yes , I should have been surprised if you had let that pass after all that has happened .
Ha-ha !
Though I did understand something of the pranks you had been up to and were telling Sofya Semyonovna about , what was the meaning of it ?
Perhaps I am quite behind the times and can ’ t understand .
For goodness ’ sake , explain it , my dear boy .
<unk> the <unk> theories ! ” “ You couldn ’ t have heard anything .
You ’ re making it all up ! ” “ But I ’ m not talking about that ( though I did hear something ) .
No , I ’ m talking of the way you keep sighing and groaning now .
The Schiller in you is in <unk> every moment , and now you tell me not to listen at doors .
If that ’ s how you feel , go and inform the police that you had this <unk> : you made a little mistake in your theory .
But if you are convinced that one mustn ’ t listen at doors , but one may murder old women at one ’ s pleasure , you ’ d better be off to America and make haste .
Run , young man !
There may still be time .
I ’ m speaking sincerely .
Haven ’ t you the money ?
I ’ ll give you the <unk> . ” “ I ’ m not thinking of that at all , ” Raskolnikov interrupted with disgust .
“ I understand ( but don ’ t put yourself out , don ’ t discuss it if you don ’ t want to ) .
I understand the questions you are worrying <unk> ones , aren ’ t they ?
<unk> of citizen and man ?
<unk> them all aside .
They are nothing to you now , ha-ha !
You ’ ll say you are still a man and a citizen .
If so you ought not to have got into this <unk> .
It ’ s no use taking up a job you are not fit for .
Well , you ’ d better shoot yourself , or don ’ t you want to ? ” “ You seem trying to <unk> me , to make me leave you . ” “ What a queer fellow !
But here we are .
<unk> to the staircase .
You see , that ’ s the way to Sofya Semyonovna .
Look , there is no one at home .
Don ’ t you believe me ?
Ask Kapernaumov .
She leaves the key with him .
Here is Madame de Kapernaumov herself .
Hey , what ?
She is rather deaf .
Has she gone out ?
Where ?
Did you hear ?
She is not in and won ’ t be till late in the evening probably .
Well , come to my room ; you wanted to come and see me , didn ’ t you ?
Here we are .
Madame Resslich ’ s not at home .
She is a woman who is always busy , an excellent woman I assure you .... She might have been of use to you if you had been a little more sensible .
Now , see !
I take this five-per-cent <unk> out of the <unk> what a lot I ’ ve got of them <unk> one will be turned into <unk> to-day .
I mustn ’ t waste any more time .
The bureau is locked , the flat is locked , and here we are again on the stairs .
Shall we take a cab ?
I ’ m going to the Islands .
Would you like a lift ?
I ’ ll take this carriage .
Ah , you refuse ?
You are tired of it !
Come for a drive !
I believe it will come on to rain .
Never mind , we ’ ll put down the <unk> .... ” Svidrigaïlov was already in the carriage .
Raskolnikov decided that his suspicions were at least for that moment unjust .
Without answering a word he turned and walked back towards the Hay Market .
If he had only turned round on his way he might have seen Svidrigaïlov get out not a hundred paces off , dismiss the cab and walk along the pavement .
But he had turned the corner and could see nothing .
<unk> disgust drew him away from Svidrigaïlov .
“ To think that I could for one instant have looked for help from that coarse brute , that depraved <unk> and <unk> ! ” he cried .
Raskolnikov ’ s judgment was uttered too <unk> and hastily : there was something about Svidrigaïlov which gave him a certain original , even a mysterious character .
As concerned his sister , Raskolnikov was convinced that Svidrigaïlov would not leave her in peace .
But it was too <unk> and unbearable to go on thinking and thinking about this .
When he was alone , he had not gone twenty paces before he sank , as usual , into deep thought .
On the bridge he stood by the railing and began gazing at the water .
And his sister was standing close by him .
He met her at the entrance to the bridge , but passed by without seeing her .
Dounia had never met him like this in the street before and was struck with dismay .
She stood still and did not know whether to call to him or not .
Suddenly she saw Svidrigaïlov coming quickly from the direction of the Hay Market .
He seemed to be approaching cautiously .
He did not go on to the bridge , but stood aside on the pavement , doing all he could to avoid Raskolnikov ’ s seeing him .
He had observed Dounia for some time and had been making signs to her .
She fancied he was <unk> to beg her not to speak to her brother , but to come to him .
That was what Dounia did .
She stole by her brother and went up to Svidrigaïlov .
“ Let us make haste away , ” Svidrigaïlov whispered to her , “ I don ’ t want Rodion Romanovitch to know of our meeting .
I must tell you I ’ ve been sitting with him in the restaurant close by , where he looked me up and I had great difficulty in getting rid of him .
He has somehow heard of my letter to you and suspects something .
It wasn ’ t you who told him , of course , but if not you , who then ? ” “ Well , we ’ ve turned the corner now , ” Dounia interrupted , “ and my brother won ’ t see us .
I have to tell you that I am going no further with you .
Speak to me here .
You can tell it all in the street . ” “ In the first place , I can ’ t say it in the street ; secondly , you must hear Sofya Semyonovna too ; and , thirdly , I will show you some papers .... Oh well , if you won ’ t agree to come with me , I shall refuse to give any explanation and go away at once .
But I beg you not to forget that a very curious secret of your <unk> brother ’ s is entirely in my keeping . ” Dounia stood still , hesitating , and looked at Svidrigaïlov with searching eyes .
“ What are you afraid of ? ” he observed quietly .
“ The town is not the country .
And even in the country you did me more harm than I did you . ” “ Have you prepared Sofya Semyonovna ? ” “ No , I have not said a word to her and am not quite certain whether she is at home now .
But most likely she is .
She has buried her stepmother to-day : she is not likely to go visiting on such a day .
For the time I don ’ t want to speak to anyone about it and I half regret having spoken to you .
The slightest <unk> is as bad as <unk> in a thing like this .
I live there in that house , we are coming to it .
That ’ s the porter of our <unk> knows me very well ; you see , he ’ s bowing ; he sees I ’ m coming with a lady and no doubt he has noticed your face already and you will be glad of that if you are afraid of me and suspicious .
Excuse my putting things so <unk> .
I haven ’ t a flat to myself ; Sofya Semyonovna ’ s room is next to <unk> lodges in the next flat .
The whole floor is let out in lodgings .
Why are you frightened like a child ?
Am I really so terrible ? ” Svidrigaïlov ’ s lips were twisted in a condescending smile ; but he was in no smiling mood .
His heart was throbbing and he could scarcely breathe .
He spoke rather loud to <unk> his growing excitement .
But Dounia did not notice this peculiar excitement , she was so irritated by his remark that she was frightened of him like a child and that he was so terrible to her .
“ Though I know that you are not a man ... of honour , I am not in the least afraid of you .
Lead the way , ” she said with apparent composure , but her face was very pale .
Svidrigaïlov stopped at Sonia ’ s room .
“ Allow me to inquire whether she is at home .... She is not .
How unfortunate !
But I know she may come quite soon .
If she ’ s gone out , it can only be to see a lady about the orphans .
Their mother is dead .... I ’ ve been <unk> and making arrangements for them .
If Sofya Semyonovna does not come back in ten minutes , I will send her to you , to-day if you like .
This is my flat .
These are my two rooms .
Madame Resslich , my landlady , has the next room .
Now , look this way .
I will show you my chief piece of evidence : this door from my bedroom leads into two perfectly empty rooms , which are to let .
Here they are ... You must look into them with some attention . ” Svidrigaïlov occupied two fairly large furnished rooms .
Dounia was looking about her mistrustfully , but saw nothing special in the furniture or position of the rooms .
Yet there was something to observe , for instance , that Svidrigaïlov ’ s flat was exactly between two <unk> of almost <unk> <unk> .
His rooms were not entered directly from the passage , but through the landlady ’ s two almost empty rooms .
<unk> a door leading out of his bedroom , Svidrigaïlov showed Dounia the two empty rooms that were to let .
Dounia stopped in the doorway , not knowing what she was called to look upon , but Svidrigaïlov hastened to explain .
“ Look here , at this second large room .
<unk> that door , it ’ s locked .
By the door stands a chair , the only one in the two rooms .
I brought it from my rooms so as to listen more <unk> .
Just the other side of the door is Sofya Semyonovna ’ s table ; she sat there talking to Rodion Romanovitch .
And I sat here listening on two <unk> evenings , for two hours each <unk> of course I was able to learn something , what do you think ? ” “ You listened ? ” “ Yes , I did .
Now come back to my room ; we can ’ t sit down here . ” He brought Avdotya Romanovna back into his <unk> and offered her a chair .
He sat down at the opposite side of the table , at least seven feet from her , but probably there was the same <unk> in his eyes which had once frightened Dounia so much .
She shuddered and once more looked about her distrustfully .
It was an <unk> gesture ; she evidently did not wish to betray her uneasiness .
But the <unk> position of Svidrigaïlov ’ s lodging had suddenly struck her .
She wanted to ask whether his landlady at least were at home , but pride kept her from asking .
Moreover , she had another trouble in her heart <unk> greater than fear for herself .
She was in great distress .
“ Here is your letter , ” she said , laying it on the table .
“ Can it be true what you write ?
You hint at a crime committed , you say , by my brother .
You hint at it too clearly ; you <unk> ’ t deny it now .
I must tell you that I ’ d heard of this stupid story before you wrote and don ’ t believe a word of it .
It ’ s a disgusting and ridiculous suspicion .
I know the story and why and how it was invented .
You can have no proofs .
You promised to prove it .
Speak !
But let me warn you that I don ’ t believe you !
I don ’ t believe you ! ” Dounia said this , speaking hurriedly , and for an instant the colour rushed to her face .
“ If you didn ’ t believe it , how could you risk coming alone to my rooms ?
Why have you come ?
Simply from curiosity ? ” “ Don ’ t <unk> me .
Speak , speak ! ” “ There ’ s no denying that you are a <unk> girl .
Upon my word , I thought you would have asked Mr. Razumihin to escort you here .
But he was not with you nor anywhere near .
I was on the <unk> .
It ’ s spirited of you , it proves you wanted to spare Rodion Romanovitch .
But everything is <unk> in you .... About your brother , what am I to say to you ?
You ’ ve just seen him yourself .
What did you think of him ? ” “ Surely that ’ s not the only thing you are building on ? ” “ No , not on that , but on his own words .
He came here on two <unk> evenings to see Sofya Semyonovna .
I ’ ve shown you where they sat .
He made a full confession to her .
He is a murderer .
He killed an old woman , a pawnbroker , with whom he had pawned things himself .
He killed her sister too , a pedlar woman called Lizaveta , who happened to come in while he was <unk> her sister .
He killed them with an axe he brought with him .
He murdered them to rob them and he did rob them .
He took money and various things ....
He told all this , word for word , to Sofya Semyonovna , the only person who knows his secret .
But she has had no share by word or <unk> in the murder ; she was as <unk> at it as you are now .
Don ’ t be anxious , she won ’ t betray him . ” “ It cannot be , ” muttered Dounia , with white lips .
She <unk> for breath .
“ It cannot be .
There was not the slightest cause , no sort of ground .... It ’ s a lie , a lie ! ” “ He robbed her , that was the cause , he took money and things .
It ’ s true that by his own <unk> he made no use of the money or things , but hid them under a stone , where they are now .
But that was because he dared not make use of them . ” “ But how could he steal , rob ?
How could he dream of it ? ” cried Dounia , and she jumped up from the chair .
“ Why , you know him , and you ’ ve seen him , can he be a thief ? ” She seemed to be imploring Svidrigaïlov ; she had entirely forgotten her fear .
“ There are thousands and millions of <unk> and possibilities , Avdotya Romanovna .
A thief <unk> and knows he is a scoundrel , but I ’ ve heard of a gentleman who broke open the <unk> .
Who knows , very likely he thought he was doing a gentlemanly thing !
Of course I should not have believed it myself if I ’ d been told of it as you have , but I believe my own ears .
He explained all the causes of it to Sofya Semyonovna too , but she did not believe her ears at first , yet she believed her own eyes at last . ” “ What ... were the causes ? ” “ It ’ s a long story , Avdotya Romanovna .
Here ’ s ... how shall I tell you ? <unk> theory of a sort , the same one by which I for instance consider that a single <unk> is permissible if the principal aim is right , a solitary <unk> and hundreds of good deeds !
It ’ s <unk> too , of course , for a young man of gifts and <unk> pride to know that if he had , for instance , a <unk> three thousand , his whole career , his whole future would be differently <unk> and yet not to have that three thousand .
<unk> to that , nervous irritability from hunger , from lodging in a hole , from rags , from a <unk> sense of the <unk> of his social position and his sister ’ s and mother ’ s position too .
Above all , vanity , pride and vanity , though goodness knows he may have good qualities too ....
I am not blaming him , please don ’ t think it ; besides , it ’ s not my business .
A special little theory came in <unk> theory of a <unk> mankind , you see , into material and superior persons , that is persons to whom the law does not <unk> owing to their <unk> , who make laws for the rest of mankind , the material , that is .
It ’ s all right as a theory , _ <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> _ .
Napoleon attracted him tremendously , that is , what affected him was that a great many men of genius have not hesitated at <unk> , but have <unk> the law without thinking about it .
He seems to have fancied that he was a genius <unk> is , he was convinced of it for a time .
He has suffered a great deal and is still suffering from the idea that he could make a theory , but was incapable of boldly <unk> the law , and so he is not a man of genius .
And that ’ s humiliating for a young man of any pride , in our day especially .... ” “ But remorse ?
You deny him any moral feeling then ?
Is he like that ? ” “ Ah , Avdotya Romanovna , everything is in a muddle now ; not that it was ever in very good order .
<unk> in general are broad in their ideas , Avdotya Romanovna , broad like their land and exceedingly disposed to the fantastic , the <unk> .
But it ’ s a misfortune to be broad without a special genius .
Do you remember what a lot of talk we had together on this subject , sitting in the evenings on the <unk> after <unk> ?
Why , you used to reproach me with <unk> !
Who knows , perhaps we were talking at the very time when he was lying here thinking over his plan .
There are no sacred <unk> amongst us , especially in the educated class , Avdotya Romanovna .
At the best someone will make them up somehow for himself out of books or from some old <unk> .
But those are for the most part the learned and all old <unk> , so that it would be almost <unk> in a man of society .
You know my opinions in general , though .
I never blame anyone .
I do nothing at all , I <unk> in that .
But we ’ ve talked of this more than once before .
I was so happy indeed as to interest you in my opinions .... You are very pale , Avdotya Romanovna . ” “ I know his theory .
I read that article of his about men to whom all is permitted .
Razumihin brought it to me . ” “ Mr.
Razumihin ?
Your brother ’ s article ?
In a magazine ?
Is there such an article ?
I didn ’ t know .
It must be interesting .
But where are you going , Avdotya Romanovna ? ” “ I want to see Sofya Semyonovna , ” Dounia articulated faintly .
“ How do I go to her ?
She has come in , perhaps .
I must see her at once .
Perhaps she ... ” Avdotya Romanovna could not finish .
Her breath literally failed her .
“ Sofya Semyonovna will not be back till night , at least I believe not .
She was to have been back at once , but if not , then she will not be in till quite late . ” “ Ah , then you are lying !
I see ... you were lying ... lying all the time ....
I don ’ t believe you !
I don ’ t believe you ! ” cried Dounia , completely losing her head .
Almost fainting , she sank on to a chair which Svidrigaïlov made haste to give her .
“ Avdotya Romanovna , what is it ?
<unk> yourself !
Here is some water .
Drink a little .... ” He <unk> some water over her .
Dounia shuddered and came to herself .
“ It has acted violently , ” Svidrigaïlov muttered to himself , frowning .
“ Avdotya Romanovna , calm yourself !
Believe me , he has friends .
We will save him .
Would you like me to take him abroad ?
I have money , I can get a ticket in three days .
And as for the murder , he will do all sorts of good deeds yet , to <unk> for it .
<unk> yourself .
He may become a great man yet .
Well , how are you ?
How do you feel ? ” “ <unk> man !
To be able to jeer at it !
Let me go ... ” “ Where are you going ? ” “ To him .
Where is he ?
Do you know ?
Why is this door locked ?
We came in at that door and now it is locked .
When did you manage to lock it ? ” “ We couldn ’ t be shouting all over the flat on such a subject .
I am far from jeering ; it ’ s simply that I ’ m sick of talking like this .
But how can you go in such a state ?
Do you want to betray him ?
You will drive him to fury , and he will give himself up .
Let me tell you , he is already being watched ; they are already on his track .
You will simply be giving him away .
Wait a little : I saw him and was talking to him just now .
He can still be saved .
Wait a bit , sit down ; let us think it over together .
I asked you to come in order to discuss it alone with you and to consider it thoroughly .
But do sit down ! ” “ How can you save him ?
Can he really be saved ? ” Dounia sat down .
Svidrigaïlov sat down beside her .
“ It all depends on you , on you , on you alone , ” he began with glowing eyes , almost in a whisper and hardly able to utter the words for emotion .
Dounia drew back from him in alarm .
He too was trembling all over .
“ You ... one word from you , and he is saved .
I ... I ’ ll save him .
I have money and friends .
I ’ ll send him away at once .
I ’ ll get a passport , two <unk> , one for him and one for me .
I have friends ... capable people ....
If you like , I ’ ll take a passport for you ... for your mother .... What do you want with Razumihin ?
I love you too ....
I love you beyond everything .... Let me kiss the <unk> of your dress , let me , let me ....
The very rustle of it is too much for me .
Tell me , ‘ do that , ’ and I ’ ll do it .
I ’ ll do everything .
I will do the impossible .
What you believe , I will believe .
I ’ ll do <unk> !
Don ’ t , don ’ t look at me like that .
Do you know that you are killing me ? ... ” He was almost beginning to rave .... Something seemed suddenly to go to his head .
Dounia jumped up and rushed to the door .
“ Open it !
Open it ! ” she called , shaking the door .
“ Open it !
Is there no one there ? ” Svidrigaïlov got up and came to himself .
His still trembling lips slowly broke into an angry mocking smile .
“ There is no one at home , ” he said quietly and emphatically .
“ The landlady has gone out , and it ’ s waste of time to shout like that .
You are only <unk> yourself <unk> . ” “ Where is the key ?
Open the door at once , at once , base man ! ” “ I have lost the key and cannot find it . ” “ This is an outrage , ” cried Dounia , turning pale as death .
She rushed to the furthest corner , where she made haste to <unk> herself with a little table .
She did not scream , but she fixed her eyes on her <unk> and watched every movement he made .
Svidrigaïlov remained standing at the other end of the room facing her .
He was positively composed , at least in appearance , but his face was pale as before .
The mocking smile did not leave his face .
“ You spoke of outrage just now , Avdotya Romanovna .
In that case you may be sure I ’ ve taken measures .
Sofya Semyonovna is not at home .
The Kapernaumovs are far <unk> are five locked rooms between .
I am at least twice as strong as you are and I have nothing to fear , besides .
For you could not complain afterwards .
You surely would not be willing actually to betray your brother ?
Besides , no one would believe you .
How should a girl have come alone to visit a solitary man in his lodgings ?
So that even if you do sacrifice your brother , you could prove nothing .
It is very difficult to prove an <unk> , Avdotya Romanovna . ” “ <unk> ! ” whispered Dounia indignantly .
“ As you like , but observe I was only speaking by way of a general proposition .
It ’ s my personal conviction that you are perfectly <unk> is hateful .
I only spoke to show you that you need have no remorse even if ... you were willing to save your brother of your own accord , as I suggest to you .
You would be simply <unk> to circumstances , to violence , in fact , if we must use that word .
Think about it .
Your brother ’ s and your mother ’ s fate are in your hands .
I will be your slave ... all my life ...
I will wait here . ” Svidrigaïlov sat down on the sofa about eight steps from Dounia .
She had not the slightest doubt now of his <unk> determination .
Besides , she knew him .
Suddenly she pulled out of her pocket a revolver , cocked it and laid it in her hand on the table .
Svidrigaïlov jumped up .
“ <unk> !
So that ’ s it , is it ? ” he cried , surprised but smiling maliciously .
“ Well , that completely <unk> the <unk> of affairs .
You ’ ve made things <unk> easier for me , Avdotya Romanovna .
But where did you get the revolver ?
Was it Mr. Razumihin ?
Why , it ’ s my revolver , an old friend !
And how I ’ ve <unk> for it !
The <unk> lessons I ’ ve given you in the country have not been thrown away . ” “ It ’ s not your revolver , it belonged to Marfa Petrovna , whom you killed , wretch !
There was nothing of yours in her house .
I took it when I began to suspect what you were capable of .
If you dare to advance one step , I swear I ’ ll kill you . ” She was frantic .
“ But your brother ?
I ask from curiosity , ” said Svidrigaïlov , still standing where he was .
“ <unk> , if you want to !
Don ’ t stir !
Don ’ t come nearer !
I ’ ll shoot !
You <unk> your wife , I know ; you are a murderer yourself ! ” She held the revolver ready .
“ Are you so positive I <unk> Marfa Petrovna ? ” “ You did !
You hinted it yourself ; you talked to me of poison ....
I know you went to get it ... you had it in readiness ....
It was your doing ....
It must have been your doing .... <unk> ! ” “ Even if that were true , it would have been for your sake ... you would have been the cause . ” “ You are lying !
I hated you always , always .... ” “ <unk> , Avdotya Romanovna !
You seem to have forgotten how you softened to me in the heat of propaganda .
I saw it in your eyes .
Do you remember that moonlight night , when the <unk> was singing ? ” “ That ’ s a lie , ” there was a flash of fury in Dounia ’ s eyes , “ that ’ s a lie and a <unk> ! ” “ A lie ?
Well , if you like , it ’ s a lie .
I made it up .
<unk> ought not to be reminded of such things , ” he smiled .
“ I know you will shoot , you pretty wild creature .
Well , shoot away ! ” Dounia raised the revolver , and deadly pale , gazed at him , measuring the distance and awaiting the first movement on his part .
Her lower lip was white and quivering and her big black eyes flashed like fire .
He had never seen her so handsome .
The fire glowing in her eyes at the moment she raised the revolver seemed to <unk> him and there was a pang of anguish in his heart .
He took a step forward and a shot rang out .
The bullet <unk> his hair and flew into the wall behind .
He stood still and laughed softly .
“ The <unk> has stung me .
She aimed straight at my head .
What ’ s this ?
Blood ? ” he pulled out his handkerchief to <unk> the blood , which flowed in a thin stream down his right temple .
The bullet seemed to have just <unk> the skin .
Dounia lowered the revolver and looked at Svidrigaïlov not so much in terror as in a sort of wild amazement .
She seemed not to understand what she was doing and what was going on .
“ Well , you missed !
<unk> again , I ’ ll wait , ” said Svidrigaïlov softly , still smiling , but gloomily .
“ If you go on like that , I shall have time to <unk> you before you cock again . ” Dounia started , quickly cocked the <unk> and again raised it .
“ Let me be , ” she cried in despair .
“ I swear I ’ ll shoot again .
I ... I ’ ll kill you . ” “ Well ... at three paces you can hardly help it .
But if you don ’ t ... then . ” His eyes flashed and he took two steps forward .
Dounia shot again : it missed fire .
“ You haven ’ t <unk> it properly .
Never mind , you have another charge there .
Get it ready , I ’ ll wait . ” He stood facing her , two paces away , waiting and gazing at her with wild determination , with feverishly passionate , <unk> , set eyes .
Dounia saw that he would sooner die than let her go .
“ And ... now , of course she would kill him , at two paces ! ” Suddenly she flung away the revolver .
“ She ’ s dropped it ! ” said Svidrigaïlov with surprise , and he drew a deep breath .
A weight seemed to have <unk> from his <unk> not only the fear of death ; indeed he may scarcely have felt it at that moment .
It was the deliverance from another feeling , darker and more bitter , which he could not himself have <unk> .
He went to Dounia and gently put his arm round her <unk> .
She did not resist , but , trembling like a leaf , looked at him with <unk> eyes .
He tried to say something , but his lips moved without being able to utter a sound .
“ Let me go , ” Dounia implored .
Svidrigaïlov shuddered .
Her voice now was quite different .
“ Then you don ’ t love me ? ” he asked softly .
Dounia shook her head .
“ And ... and you can ’ t ?
Never ? ” he whispered in despair .
“ Never ! ” There followed a moment of terrible , dumb struggle in the heart of Svidrigaïlov .
He looked at her with an indescribable <unk> .
Suddenly he withdrew his arm , turned quickly to the window and stood facing it .
Another moment passed .
“ Here ’ s the key . ” He took it out of the left pocket of his coat and laid it on the table behind him , without turning or looking at Dounia .
“ Take it !
Make haste ! ” He looked <unk> out of the window .
Dounia went up to the table to take the key .
“ Make haste !
Make haste ! ” repeated Svidrigaïlov , still without turning or moving .
But there seemed a terrible significance in the tone of that “ make haste . ” Dounia understood it , snatched up the key , flew to the door , unlocked it quickly and rushed out of the room .
A minute later , beside herself , she ran out on to the canal bank in the direction of X. Bridge .
Svidrigaïlov remained three minutes standing at the window .
At last he slowly turned , looked about him and passed his hand over his forehead .
A strange smile contorted his face , a pitiful , sad , weak smile , a smile of despair .
The blood , which was already getting dry , smeared his hand .
He looked angrily at it , then wetted a towel and washed his temple .
The revolver which Dounia had flung away lay near the door and suddenly caught his eye .
He picked it up and examined it .
It was a little pocket <unk> revolver of old-fashioned <unk> .
There were still two <unk> and one <unk> left in it .
It could be fired again .
He thought a little , put the revolver in his pocket , took his hat and went out .
CHAPTER VI He spent that evening till ten o ’ clock going from one low <unk> to another .
Katia too turned up and <unk> another gutter song , how a certain “ <unk> and <unk> , ” “ began kissing Katia . ” Svidrigaïlov treated Katia and the <unk> and some singers and the <unk> and two little clerks .
He was particularly drawn to these clerks by the fact that they both had <unk> noses , one bent to the left and the other to the right .
They took him finally to a pleasure garden , where he paid for their entrance .
There was one <unk> <unk> <unk> and three bushes in the garden , besides a “ <unk> , ” which was in reality a <unk> where tea too was served , and there were a few green tables and chairs standing round it .
A chorus of wretched singers and a drunken but exceedingly depressed German <unk> from <unk> with a red nose <unk> the public .
The clerks quarrelled with some other clerks and a fight seemed imminent .
Svidrigaïlov was chosen to decide the dispute .
He listened to them for a quarter of an hour , but they shouted so loud that there was no possibility of understanding them .
The only fact that seemed certain was that one of them had stolen something and had even succeeded in selling it on the spot to a Jew , but would not share the spoil with his companion .
Finally it appeared that the stolen object was a <unk> <unk> to the <unk> .
It was missed and the affair began to seem <unk> .
Svidrigaïlov paid for the spoon , got up , and walked out of the garden .
It was about six o ’ clock .
He had not drunk a drop of wine all this time and had ordered tea more for the sake of appearances than anything .
It was a dark and stifling evening .
<unk> <unk> came over the sky about ten o ’ clock .
There was a clap of thunder , and the rain came down like a <unk> .
The water fell not in drops , but beat on the earth in <unk> .
There were <unk> of lightning every minute and each flash lasted while one could count five .
<unk> to the skin , he went home , locked himself in , opened the bureau , took out all his money and tore up two or three papers .
Then , putting the money in his pocket , he was about to change his clothes , but , looking out of the window and listening to the thunder and the rain , he gave up the idea , took up his hat and went out of the room without <unk> the door .
He went straight to Sonia .
She was at home .
She was not alone : the four Kapernaumov children were with her .
She was giving them tea .
She received Svidrigaïlov in respectful silence , looking <unk> at his <unk> clothes .
The children all ran away at once in indescribable terror .
Svidrigaïlov sat down at the table and asked Sonia to sit beside him .
She timidly prepared to listen .
“ I may be going to America , Sofya Semyonovna , ” said Svidrigaïlov , “ and as I am probably seeing you for the last time , I have come to make some arrangements .
Well , did you see the lady to-day ?
I know what she said to you , you need not tell me . ” ( Sonia made a movement and blushed . )
“ Those people have their own way of doing things .
As to your <unk> and your brother , they are really provided for and the money <unk> to them I ’ ve put into <unk> keeping and have received <unk> .
You had better take charge of the <unk> , in case anything happens .
Here , take them !
Well now , that ’ s settled .
Here are three <unk> <unk> to the value of three thousand roubles .
Take those for yourself , entirely for yourself , and let that be strictly between ourselves , so that no one knows of it , whatever you hear .
You will need the money , for to go on living in the old way , Sofya Semyonovna , is bad , and besides there is no need for it now . ” “ I am so much <unk> to you , and so are the children and my stepmother , ” said Sonia hurriedly , “ and if I ’ ve said so little ... please don ’ t consider ... ” “ That ’ s enough !
that ’ s enough ! ” “ But as for the money , Arkady Ivanovitch , I am very grateful to you , but I don ’ t need it now .
I can always earn my own living .
Don ’ t think me ungrateful .
If you are so charitable , that money .... ” “ It ’ s for you , for you , Sofya Semyonovna , and please don ’ t waste words over it .
I haven ’ t time for it .
You will want it .
Rodion Romanovitch has two <unk> : a bullet in the brain or Siberia . ” ( Sonia looked wildly at him , and started . )
“ Don ’ t be uneasy , I know all about it from himself and I am not a gossip ; I won ’ t tell anyone .
It was good advice when you told him to give himself up and confess .
It would be much better for him .
Well , if it turns out to be Siberia , he will go and you will follow him .
That ’ s so , isn ’ t it ?
And if so , you ’ ll need money .
You ’ ll need it for him , do you understand ?
<unk> it to you is the same as my giving it to him .
Besides , you promised Amalia Ivanovna to pay what ’ s owing .
I heard you .
How can you undertake such obligations so <unk> , Sofya Semyonovna ?
It was Katerina Ivanovna ’ s debt and not yours , so you ought not to have taken any notice of the German woman .
You can ’ t get through the world like that .
If you are ever <unk> about <unk> or the day after you will be <unk> ’ t say anything about my coming to see you now and don ’ t show the money to anyone or say a word about it .
Well , now good-bye . ” ( He got up . )
“ My greetings to Rodion Romanovitch .
By the way , you ’ d better put the money for the present in Mr. Razumihin ’ s keeping .
You know Mr. Razumihin ?
Of course you do .
He ’ s not a bad fellow .
Take it to him to-morrow or ... when the time comes .
And till then , hide it carefully . ” Sonia too jumped up from her chair and looked in dismay at Svidrigaïlov .
She longed to speak , to ask a question , but for the first moments she did not dare and did not know how to begin .
“ How can you ... how can you be going now , in such rain ? ” “ Why , be starting for America , and be stopped by rain !
Ha , ha !
Good-bye , Sofya Semyonovna , my dear !
<unk> and live long , you will be of use to others .
By the way ... tell Mr. Razumihin I send my greetings to him .
Tell him Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov <unk> his greetings .
Be sure to . ” He went out , leaving Sonia in a state of wondering anxiety and vague <unk> .
It appeared afterwards that on the same evening , at twenty past eleven , he made another very eccentric and unexpected visit .
The rain still persisted .
<unk> to the skin , he walked into the little flat where the parents of his betrothed lived , in <unk> Street in Vassilyevsky Island .
He knocked some time before he was admitted , and his visit at first caused great <unk> ; but Svidrigaïlov could be very fascinating when he liked , so that the first , and indeed very intelligent <unk> of the sensible parents that Svidrigaïlov had probably had so much to drink that he did not know what he was doing vanished immediately .
The decrepit father was <unk> in to see Svidrigaïlov by the tender and sensible mother , who as usual began the conversation with various irrelevant questions .
She never asked a direct question , but began by smiling and rubbing her hands and then , if she were obliged to ascertain <unk> instance , when Svidrigaïlov would like to have the <unk> would begin by interested and almost eager questions about Paris and the court life there , and only by degrees brought the conversation round to <unk> Street .
On other occasions this had of course been very impressive , but this time Arkady Ivanovitch seemed particularly impatient , and insisted on seeing his betrothed at once , though he had been informed , to begin with , that she had already gone to bed .
The girl of course appeared .
Svidrigaïlov informed her at once that he was obliged by very important affairs to leave Petersburg for a time , and therefore brought her fifteen thousand roubles and begged her accept them as a present from him , as he had long been intending to make her this trifling present before their wedding .
The logical connection of the present with his immediate departure and the <unk> necessity of visiting them for that purpose in pouring rain at midnight was not made clear .
But it all went off very well ; even the inevitable <unk> of wonder and regret , the inevitable questions were extraordinarily few and restrained .
On the other hand , the gratitude expressed was most glowing and was <unk> by tears from the most sensible of mothers .
Svidrigaïlov got up , laughed , kissed his betrothed , <unk> her cheek , declared he would soon come back , and noticing in her eyes , together with childish curiosity , a sort of earnest dumb inquiry , reflected and kissed her again , though he felt sincere anger inwardly at the thought that his present would be immediately locked up in the keeping of the most sensible of mothers .
He went away , leaving them all in a state of extraordinary excitement , but the tender mamma , speaking quietly in a half whisper , settled some of the most important of their doubts , <unk> that Svidrigaïlov was a great man , a man of great affairs and connections and of great <unk> was no knowing what he had in his mind .
He would start off on a journey and give away money just as the fancy took him , so that there was nothing surprising about it .
Of course it was strange that he was wet through , but <unk> , for instance , are even more eccentric , and all these people of high society didn ’ t think of what was said of them and didn ’ t stand on ceremony .
Possibly , indeed , he came like that on purpose to show that he was not afraid of anyone .
Above all , not a word should be said about it , for God knows what might come of it , and the money must be locked up , and it was most <unk> that <unk> , the cook , had not left the kitchen .
And above all not a word must be said to that old cat , Madame Resslich , and so on and so on .
They sat up whispering till two o ’ clock , but the girl went to bed much earlier , amazed and rather sorrowful .
Svidrigaïlov meanwhile , exactly at midnight , crossed the bridge on the way back to the <unk> .
The rain had ceased and there was a <unk> wind .
He began shivering , and for one moment he gazed at the black <unk> of the Little Neva with a look of special interest , even inquiry .
But he soon felt it very cold , standing by the water ; he turned and went towards <unk>
Prospect .
He walked along that <unk> street for a long time , almost half an hour , more than once stumbling in the dark on the wooden pavement , but continually looking for something on the right side of the street .
He had noticed passing through this street lately that there was a hotel somewhere towards the end , built of wood , but fairly large , and its name he remembered was something like <unk> .
He was not mistaken : the hotel was so conspicuous in that <unk> place that he could not fail to see it even in the dark .
It was a long , <unk> wooden building , and in spite of the late hour there were <unk> in the windows and signs of life within .
He went in and asked a ragged fellow who met him in the corridor for a room .
The latter , scanning Svidrigaïlov , pulled himself together and led him at once to a close and tiny room in the distance , at the end of the corridor , under the stairs .
There was no other , all were occupied .
The ragged fellow looked inquiringly .
“ Is there tea ? ” asked Svidrigaïlov .
“ Yes , sir . ” “ What else is there ? ” “ <unk> , vodka , <unk> . ” “ Bring me tea and veal . ” “ And you want nothing else ? ” he asked with apparent surprise .
“ Nothing , nothing . ” The ragged man went away , completely <unk> .
“ It must be a nice place , ” thought Svidrigaïlov .
“ How was it I didn ’ t know it ?
I expect I look as if I came from a <unk> <unk> and have had some <unk> on the way .
It would be interesting to know who stayed here ? ” He lighted the candle and looked at the room more carefully .
It was a room so low-pitched that Svidrigaïlov could only just stand up in it ; it had one window ; the bed , which was very dirty , and the <unk> chair and table almost filled it up .
The walls looked as though they were made of <unk> , covered with shabby paper , so torn and dusty that the pattern was <unk> , though the general <unk> still be made out .
One of the walls was cut short by the sloping ceiling , though the room was not an <unk> but just under the stairs .
Svidrigaïlov set down the candle , sat down on the bed and sank into thought .
But a strange persistent murmur which sometimes rose to a shout in the next room attracted his attention .
The murmur had not ceased from the moment he entered the room .
He listened : someone was <unk> and almost <unk> scolding , but he heard only one voice .
Svidrigaïlov got up , <unk> the light with his hand and at once he saw light through a crack in the wall ; he went up and peeped through .
The room , which was somewhat larger than his , had two <unk> .
One of them , a very <unk> man with a red <unk> face , was standing in the <unk> of an orator , without his coat , with his legs wide apart to preserve his balance , and <unk> himself on the breast .
He reproached the other with being a beggar , with having no standing whatever .
He declared that he had taken the other out of the gutter and he could turn him out when he liked , and that only the finger of Providence sees it all .
The object of his reproaches was sitting in a chair , and had the air of a man who wants dreadfully to <unk> , but can ’ t .
He sometimes turned <unk> and <unk> eyes on the speaker , but obviously had not the slightest idea what he was talking about and scarcely heard it .
A candle was burning down on the table ; there were <unk> , a nearly empty bottle of vodka , bread and cucumber , and glasses with the <unk> of stale tea .
After gazing attentively at this , Svidrigaïlov turned away indifferently and sat down on the bed .
The ragged attendant , returning with the tea , could not resist asking him again whether he didn ’ t want anything more , and again receiving a <unk> reply , finally withdrew .
Svidrigaïlov made haste to drink a glass of tea to warm himself , but could not eat anything .
He began to feel feverish .
He took off his coat and , <unk> himself in the blanket , lay down on the bed .
He was annoyed .
“ It would have been better to be well for the occasion , ” he thought with a smile .
The room was close , the candle burnt dimly , the wind was <unk> outside , he heard a mouse <unk> in the corner and the room smelt of <unk> and of leather .
He lay in a sort of <unk> : one thought followed another .
He felt a longing to fix his imagination on something .
“ It must be a garden under the window , ” he thought .
“ There ’ s a sound of trees .
How I dislike the sound of trees on a <unk> night , in the dark !
They give one a horrid feeling . ” He remembered how he had disliked it when he passed Petrovsky <unk> just now .
This reminded him of the bridge over the Little Neva and he felt cold again as he had when standing there .
“ I never have liked water , ” he thought , “ even in a <unk> , ” and he suddenly smiled again at a strange idea : “ Surely now all these questions of taste and comfort ought not to matter , but I ’ ve become more particular , like an animal that <unk> out a special place ... for such an occasion .
I ought to have gone into the Petrovsky <unk> !
I suppose it seemed dark , cold , ha-ha !
As though I were seeking pleasant sensations ! ...
By the way , why haven ’ t I put out the candle ? ” he <unk> it out .
“ They ’ ve gone to bed next door , ” he thought , not seeing the light at the crack .
“ Well , now , Marfa Petrovna , now is the time for you to turn up ; it ’ s dark , and the very time and place for you .
But now you won ’ t come ! ” He suddenly recalled how , an hour before carrying out his design on Dounia , he had <unk> Raskolnikov to trust her to Razumihin ’ s keeping .
“ I suppose I really did say it , as Raskolnikov guessed , to <unk> myself .
But what a rogue that Raskolnikov is !
He ’ s gone through a good deal .
He may be a successful rogue in time when he ’ s got over his nonsense .
But now he ’ s _ too _ eager for life .
These young men are contemptible on that point .
But , hang the fellow !
Let him please himself , it ’ s nothing to do with me . ” He could not get to sleep .
By degrees Dounia ’ s image rose before him , and a shudder ran over him .
“ No , I must give up all that now , ” he thought , rousing himself .
“ I must think of something else .
It ’ s queer and funny .
I never had a great hatred for anyone , I never particularly <unk> to <unk> myself even , and that ’ s a bad sign , a bad sign , a bad sign .
I never liked quarrelling either , and never lost my <unk> ’ s a bad sign too .
And the <unk> I made her just now , <unk> !
<unk> knows ? <unk> she would have made a new man of me somehow .... ” He ground his teeth and sank into silence again .
Again Dounia ’ s image rose before him , just as she was when , after <unk> the first time , she had lowered the revolver in terror and gazed blankly at him , so that he might have seized her twice over and she would not have lifted a hand to defend herself if he had not reminded her .
He recalled how at that instant he felt almost sorry for her , how he had felt a pang at his heart ... “ <unk> !
<unk> , these thoughts again !
I must put it away ! ” He was <unk> off ; the feverish shiver had ceased , when suddenly something seemed to run over his arm and leg under the <unk> .
He started .
“ Ugh !
hang it !
I believe it ’ s a mouse , ” he thought , “ that ’ s the veal I left on the table . ” He felt fearfully <unk> to pull off the blanket , get up , get cold , but all at once something unpleasant ran over his leg again .
He pulled off the blanket and lighted the candle .
<unk> with feverish chill he bent down to examine the bed : there was nothing .
He shook the blanket and suddenly a mouse jumped out on the sheet .
He tried to catch it , but the mouse ran to and fro in <unk> without leaving the bed , slipped between his fingers , ran over his hand and suddenly darted under the pillow .
He threw down the pillow , but in one instant felt something <unk> on his chest and <unk> over his body and down his back under his shirt .
He trembled nervously and woke up .
The room was dark .
He was lying on the bed and wrapped up in the blanket as before .
The wind was howling under the window .
“ How disgusting , ” he thought with annoyance .
He got up and sat on the edge of the bedstead with his back to the window .
“ It ’ s better not to sleep at all , ” he decided .
There was a cold damp <unk> from the window , however ; without getting up he drew the blanket over him and wrapped himself in it .
He was not thinking of anything and did not want to think .
But one image rose after another , incoherent <unk> of thought without beginning or end passed through his mind .
He sank into drowsiness .
Perhaps the cold , or the <unk> , or the dark , or the wind that <unk> under the window and <unk> the trees roused a sort of persistent craving for the fantastic .
He kept <unk> on images of flowers , he fancied a charming flower garden , a bright , warm , almost hot day , a <unk> day .
A fine , <unk> country <unk> in the English taste <unk> with fragrant flowers , with flower beds going round the house ; the <unk> , <unk> in <unk> , was <unk> with beds of <unk> .
A light , cool staircase , <unk> with rich <unk> , was decorated with rare <unk> in <unk> pots .
He noticed particularly in the windows <unk> of tender , white , heavily fragrant <unk> bending over their bright , green , thick long <unk> .
He was <unk> to move away from them , but he went up the stairs and came into a large , high <unk> and again <unk> the windows , the doors on to the <unk> , and on the <unk> <unk> flowers .
The floors were <unk> with <unk> fragrant hay , the windows were open , a fresh , cool , light air came into the room .
The birds were <unk> under the window , and in the middle of the room , on a table covered with a white satin <unk> , stood a coffin .
The coffin was covered with white silk and <unk> with a thick white <unk> ; <unk> of flowers <unk> it on all sides .
Among the flowers lay a girl in a white muslin dress , with her arms crossed and pressed on her bosom , as though <unk> out of <unk> .
But her loose fair hair was wet ; there was a <unk> of <unk> on her head .
The stern and already <unk> <unk> of her face looked as though <unk> of <unk> too , and the smile on her pale lips was full of an immense <unk> misery and sorrowful appeal .
Svidrigaïlov knew that girl ; there was no holy image , no burning candle beside the coffin ; no sound of prayers : the girl had drowned herself .
She was only fourteen , but her heart was broken .
And she had destroyed herself , crushed by an insult that had <unk> and amazed that childish soul , had <unk> that angel purity with <unk> disgrace and torn from her a last scream of despair , <unk> and <unk> disregarded , on a dark night in the cold and wet while the wind <unk> .... Svidrigaïlov came to himself , got up from the bed and went to the window .
He felt for the latch and opened it .
The wind <unk> furiously into the little room and stung his face and his chest , only covered with his shirt , as though with <unk> .
Under the window there must have been something like a garden , and apparently a pleasure garden .
There , too , probably there were <unk> and singing in the <unk> .
Now drops of rain flew in at the window from the trees and bushes ; it was dark as in a <unk> , so that he could only just make out some dark <unk> of objects .
Svidrigaïlov , bending down with elbows on the <unk> , gazed for five minutes into the darkness ; the <unk> of a <unk> , followed by a second one , <unk> in the darkness of the night .
“ Ah , the <unk> !
The river is <unk> , ” he thought .
“ By morning it will be <unk> down the street in the lower parts , <unk> the <unk> and <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> will <unk> out , and men will curse in the rain and wind as they drag their rubbish to their upper storeys .
What time is it now ? ” And he had hardly thought it when , somewhere near , a clock on the wall , <unk> away hurriedly , struck three .
“ <unk> !
It will be light in an hour !
Why wait ?
I ’ ll go out at once straight to the <unk> .
I ’ ll choose a great bush there <unk> with rain , so that as soon as one ’ s shoulder <unk> it , millions of drops <unk> on one ’ s head . ” He moved away from the window , shut it , lighted the candle , put on his waistcoat , his overcoat and his hat and went out , carrying the candle , into the passage to look for the ragged attendant who would be asleep somewhere in the midst of <unk> and all sorts of rubbish , to pay him for the room and leave the hotel .
“ It ’ s the best minute ; I couldn ’ t choose a better . ” He walked for some time through a long narrow corridor without finding anyone and was just going to call out , when suddenly in a dark corner between an old cupboard and the door he caught sight of a strange object which seemed to be alive .
He bent down with the candle and saw a little girl , not more than five years old , shivering and crying , with her clothes as wet as a <unk> <unk> .
She did not seem afraid of Svidrigaïlov , but looked at him with blank amazement out of her big black eyes .
Now and then she sobbed as children do when they have been crying a long time , but are beginning to be comforted .
The child ’ s face was pale and tired , she was numb with cold .
“ How can she have come here ?
She must have hidden here and not slept all night . ” He began questioning her .
The child suddenly becoming animated , chattered away in her baby language , something about “ <unk> ” and that “ <unk> would beat her , ” and about some cup that she had “ <unk> . ” The child chattered on without stopping .
He could only guess from what she said that she was a <unk> child , whose mother , probably a drunken cook , in the service of the hotel , <unk> and frightened her ; that the child had broken a cup of her mother ’ s and was so frightened that she had run away the evening before , had hidden for a long while somewhere outside in the rain , at last had made her way in here , hidden behind the cupboard and spent the night there , crying and trembling from the damp , the darkness and the fear that she would be badly beaten for it .
He took her in his arms , went back to his room , sat her on the bed , and began undressing her .
The torn shoes which she had on her <unk> feet were as wet as if they had been standing in a puddle all night .
When he had undressed her , he put her on the bed , covered her up and wrapped her in the blanket from her head downwards .
She fell asleep at once .
Then he sank into <unk> musing again .
“ What folly to trouble myself , ” he decided suddenly with an oppressive feeling of annoyance .
“ What idiocy ! ” In vexation he took up the candle to go and look for the ragged attendant again and make haste to go away .
“ Damn the child ! ” he thought as he opened the door , but he turned again to see whether the child was asleep .
He raised the blanket carefully .
The child was sleeping soundly , she had got warm under the blanket , and her pale cheeks were flushed .
But strange to say that flush seemed <unk> and <unk> than the <unk> cheeks of childhood .
“ It ’ s a flush of fever , ” thought Svidrigaïlov .
It was like the flush from drinking , as though she had been given a full glass to drink .
Her crimson lips were hot and glowing ; but what was this ?
He suddenly fancied that her long black eyelashes were quivering , as though the <unk> were opening and a sly <unk> eye peeped out with an <unk> wink , as though the little girl were not asleep , but pretending .
Yes , it was so .
Her lips parted in a smile .
The corners of her mouth <unk> , as though she were trying to control them .
But now she quite gave up all effort , now it was a grin , a broad grin ; there was something shameless , <unk> in that quite <unk> face ; it was depravity , it was the face of a harlot , the shameless face of a French harlot .
Now both eyes opened wide ; they turned a glowing , shameless glance upon him ; they laughed , invited him ....
There was something infinitely hideous and shocking in that laugh , in those eyes , in such <unk> in the face of a child .
“ What , at five years old ? ” Svidrigaïlov muttered in genuine horror .
“ What does it mean ? ” And now she turned to him , her little face all <unk> , holding out her arms .... “ <unk> child ! ” Svidrigaïlov cried , raising his hand to strike her , but at that moment he woke up .
He was in the same bed , still wrapped in the blanket .
The candle had not been lighted , and daylight was streaming in at the windows .
“ I ’ ve had <unk> all night ! ” He got up angrily , feeling utterly shattered ; his <unk> ached .
There was a thick mist outside and he could see nothing .
It was nearly five .
He had <unk> himself !
He got up , put on his still damp <unk> and overcoat .
<unk> the revolver in his pocket , he took it out and then he sat down , took a notebook out of his pocket and in the most conspicuous place on the title page wrote a few lines in large letters .
<unk> them over , he sank into thought with his elbows on the table .
The revolver and the notebook lay beside him .
Some <unk> woke up and settled on the untouched veal , which was still on the table .
He stared at them and at last with his free right hand began trying to catch one .
He tried till he was tired , but could not catch it .
At last , realising that he was engaged in this interesting pursuit , he started , got up and walked resolutely out of the room .
A minute later he was in the street .
A thick <unk> mist hung over the town .
Svidrigaïlov walked along the <unk> dirty wooden pavement towards the Little Neva .
He was <unk> the <unk> of the Little Neva swollen in the night , Petrovsky Island , the wet <unk> , the wet grass , the wet trees and bushes and at last the bush ....
He began <unk> staring at the houses , trying to think of something else .
There was not a cabman or a <unk> in the street .
The bright yellow , wooden , little houses looked dirty and dejected with their closed <unk> .
The cold and damp <unk> his whole body and he began to shiver .
From time to time he came across shop signs and read each carefully .
At last he reached the end of the wooden pavement and came to a big stone house .
A dirty , shivering dog crossed his path with its tail between its legs .
A man in a greatcoat lay face downwards ; dead drunk , across the pavement .
He looked at him and went on .
A high tower stood up on the left .
“ Bah ! ” he shouted , “ here is a place .
Why should it be Petrovsky ?
It will be in the presence of an official witness anyway .... ” He almost smiled at this new thought and turned into the street where there was the big house with the tower .
At the great closed gates of the house , a little man stood with his shoulder leaning against them , wrapped in a grey soldier ’ s coat , with a copper Achilles <unk> on his head .
He cast a <unk> and indifferent glance at Svidrigaïlov .
His face wore that <unk> look of <unk> dejection , which is so <unk> printed on all faces of <unk> race without <unk> .
They both , Svidrigaïlov and Achilles , stared at each other for a few minutes without speaking .
At last it struck Achilles as irregular for a man not drunk to be standing three steps from him , staring and not saying a word .
“ What do you want here ? ” he said , without moving or changing his position .
“ Nothing , brother , good morning , ” answered Svidrigaïlov .
“ This isn ’ t the place . ” “ I am going to foreign parts , brother . ” “ To foreign parts ? ” “ To America . ” “ America . ” Svidrigaïlov took out the revolver and cocked it .
Achilles raised his eyebrows .
“ I say , this is not the place for such jokes ! ” “ Why shouldn ’ t it be the place ? ” “ Because it isn ’ t . ” “ Well , brother , I don ’ t mind that .
It ’ s a good place .
When you are asked , you just say he was going , he said , to America . ” He put the revolver to his right temple .
“ You can ’ t do it here , it ’ s not the place , ” cried Achilles , rousing himself , his eyes growing bigger and bigger .
Svidrigaïlov pulled the <unk> .
CHAPTER VII The same day , about seven o ’ clock in the evening , Raskolnikov was on his way to his mother ’ s and sister ’ s <unk> lodging in Bakaleyev ’ s house which Razumihin had found for them .
The stairs went up from the street .
Raskolnikov walked with <unk> steps , as though still hesitating whether to go or not .
But nothing would have turned him back : his decision was taken .
“ Besides , it doesn ’ t matter , they still know nothing , ” he thought , “ and they are used to thinking of me as eccentric . ” He was <unk> dressed : his clothes torn and dirty , soaked with a night ’ s rain .
His face was almost distorted from fatigue , <unk> , the inward conflict that had lasted for <unk> hours .
He had spent all the previous night alone , God knows where .
But anyway he had reached a decision .
He knocked at the door which was opened by his mother .
Dounia was not at home .
Even the servant happened to be out .
At first Pulcheria Alexandrovna was <unk> with joy and surprise ; then she took him by the hand and drew him into the room .
“ Here you are ! ” she began , faltering with joy .
“ Don ’ t be angry with me , Rodya , for <unk> you so <unk> with tears : I am laughing not crying .
Did you think I was crying ?
No , I am delighted , but I ’ ve got into such a stupid habit of <unk> tears .
I ’ ve been like that ever since your father ’ s death .
I cry for anything .
Sit down , dear boy , you must be tired ; I see you are .
Ah , how <unk> you are . ” “ I was in the rain yesterday , mother .... ” Raskolnikov began .
“ No , no , ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna hurriedly interrupted , “ you thought I was going to <unk> you in the womanish way I used to ; don ’ t be anxious , I understand , I understand it all : now I ’ ve learned the ways here and truly I see for myself that they are better .
I ’ ve made up my mind once for all : how could I understand your plans and expect you to give an account of them ?
God knows what <unk> and plans you may have , or what ideas you are <unk> ; so it ’ s not for me to keep <unk> your elbow , asking you what you are thinking about ?
But , my goodness !
why am I running to and fro as though I were crazy ... ?
I am reading your article in the magazine for the third time , Rodya .
Dmitri Prokofitch brought it to me .
<unk> I saw it I cried out to myself : ‘ There , foolish one , ’ I thought , ‘ that ’ s what he is busy about ; that ’ s the solution of the mystery !
<unk> people are always like that .
He may have some new ideas in his head just now ; he is thinking them over and I worry him and upset him . ’ I read it , my dear , and of course there was a great deal I did not understand ; but that ’ s only <unk> should I ? ” “ Show me , mother . ” Raskolnikov took the magazine and glanced at his article .
<unk> as it was with his mood and his circumstances , he felt that strange and bitter sweet sensation that every author <unk> the first time he sees himself in print ; besides , he was only <unk> .
It lasted only a moment .
After reading a few lines he frowned and his heart throbbed with anguish .
He recalled all the inward conflict of the preceding months .
He flung the article on the table with disgust and anger .
“ But , however foolish I may be , Rodya , I can see for myself that you will very soon be one of the <unk> not the leading <unk> the world of Russian thought .
And they dared to think you were mad !
You don ’ t know , but they really thought that .
Ah , the despicable <unk> , how could they understand genius !
And Dounia , Dounia was all but believing it--what do you say to that ?
Your father sent twice to <unk> first time <unk> ( I ’ ve got the <unk> and will show you ) and the second time a whole <unk> ( I begged him to let me copy it out ) and how we prayed that they should be <unk> weren ’ t !
I was breaking my heart , Rodya , six or seven days ago over your food and your clothes and the way you are living .
But now I see again how foolish I was , for you can attain any position you like by your intellect and talent .
No doubt you don ’ t care about that for the present and you are occupied with much more important matters .... ” “ Dounia ’ s not at home , mother ? ” “ No , Rodya .
I often don ’ t see her ; she leaves me alone .
Dmitri Prokofitch comes to see me , it ’ s so good of him , and he always <unk> about you .
He loves you and respects you , my dear .
I don ’ t say that Dounia is very wanting in consideration .
I am not complaining .
She has her ways and I have mine ; she seems to have got some secrets of late and I never have any secrets from you two .
Of course , I am sure that Dounia has far too much sense , and besides she loves you and me ... but I don ’ t know what it will all lead to .
You ’ ve made me so happy by coming now , Rodya , but she has missed you by going out ; when she comes in I ’ ll tell her : ‘ Your brother came in while you were out .
Where have you been all this time ? ’ You mustn ’ t spoil me , Rodya , you know ; come when you can , but if you can ’ t , it doesn ’ t matter , I can wait .
I shall know , anyway , that you are fond of me , that will be enough for me .
I shall read what you write , I shall hear about you from everyone , and sometimes you ’ ll come yourself to see me .
What could be better ?
Here you ’ ve come now to comfort your mother , I see that . ” Here Pulcheria Alexandrovna began to cry .
“ Here I am again !
Don ’ t mind my foolishness .
My goodness , why am I sitting here ? ” she cried , jumping up .
“ There is coffee and I don ’ t offer you any .
Ah , that ’ s the <unk> of old age .
I ’ ll get it at once ! ” “ Mother , don ’ t trouble , I am going at once .
I haven ’ t come for that .
Please listen to me . ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna went up to him timidly .
“ Mother , whatever happens , whatever you hear about me , whatever you are told about me , will you always love me as you do now ? ” he asked suddenly from the <unk> of his heart , as though not thinking of his words and not weighing them .
“ Rodya , Rodya , what is the matter ?
How can you ask me such a question ?
Why , who will tell me anything about you ?
Besides , I shouldn ’ t believe anyone , I should refuse to listen . ” “ I ’ ve come to assure you that I ’ ve always loved you and I am glad that we are alone , even glad Dounia is out , ” he went on with the same impulse .
“ I have come to tell you that though you will be unhappy , you must believe that your son loves you now more than himself , and that all you thought about me , that I was cruel and didn ’ t care about you , was all a mistake .
I shall never cease to love you .... Well , that ’ s enough : I thought I must do this and begin with this .... ” Pulcheria Alexandrovna embraced him in silence , pressing him to her bosom and weeping gently .
“ I don ’ t know what is wrong with you , Rodya , ” she said at last .
“ I ’ ve been thinking all this time that we were simply <unk> you and now I see that there is a great sorrow in store for you , and that ’ s why you are miserable .
I ’ ve foreseen it a long time , Rodya .
Forgive me for speaking about it .
I keep thinking about it and lie awake at nights .
Your sister lay talking in her sleep all last night , talking of nothing but you .
I caught something , but I couldn ’ t make it out .
I felt all the morning as though I were going to be hanged , waiting for something , expecting something , and now it has come !
Rodya , Rodya , where are you going ?
You are going away somewhere ? ” “ Yes . ” “ That ’ s what I thought !
I can come with you , you know , if you need me .
And Dounia , too ; she loves you , she loves you <unk> Sofya Semyonovna may come with us if you like .
You see , I am glad to look upon her as a daughter even ... Dmitri Prokofitch will help us to go together .
But ... where ... are you going ? ” “ Good-bye , mother . ” “ What , to-day ? ” she cried , as though losing him for ever .
“ I can ’ t stay , I must go now .... ” “ And can ’ t I come with you ? ” “ No , but kneel down and pray to God for me .
Your prayer perhaps will reach Him . ” “ Let me bless you and sign you with the cross .
That ’ s right , that ’ s right .
Oh , God , what are we doing ? ” Yes , he was glad , he was very glad that there was no one there , that he was alone with his mother .
For the first time after all those awful months his heart was softened .
He fell down before her , he kissed her feet and both wept , embracing .
And she was not surprised and did not question him this time .
For some days she had realised that something awful was happening to her son and that now some terrible minute had come for him .
“ Rodya , my darling , my first born , ” she said sobbing , “ now you are just as when you were little .
You would run like this to me and hug me and kiss me .
When your father was living and we were poor , you comforted us simply by being with us and when I buried your father , how often we wept together at his grave and embraced , as now .
And if I ’ ve been crying lately , it ’ s that my mother ’ s heart had a foreboding of trouble .
The first time I saw you , that evening , you remember , as soon as we arrived here , I guessed simply from your eyes .
My heart sank at once , and to-day when I opened the door and looked at you , I thought the fatal hour had come .
Rodya , Rodya , you are not going away to-day ? ” “ No ! ” “ You ’ ll come again ? ” “ Yes ... I ’ ll come . ” “ Rodya , don ’ t be angry , I don ’ t dare to question you .
I know I mustn ’ t .
Only say two words to <unk> it far where you are going ? ” “ Very far . ” “ What is awaiting you there ?
Some post or career for you ? ” “ What God <unk> ... only pray for me . ” Raskolnikov went to the door , but she clutched him and gazed <unk> into his eyes .
Her face worked with terror .
“ Enough , mother , ” said Raskolnikov , deeply regretting that he had come .
“ Not for ever , it ’ s not yet for ever ?
You ’ ll come , you ’ ll come to-morrow ? ” “ I will , I will , good-bye . ” He tore himself away at last .
It was a warm , fresh , bright evening ; it had cleared up in the morning .
Raskolnikov went to his lodgings ; he made haste .
He wanted to finish all before sunset .
He did not want to meet anyone till then .
Going up the stairs he noticed that Nastasya rushed from the samovar to watch him intently .
“ Can anyone have come to see me ? ” he wondered .
He had a <unk> <unk> of Porfiry .
But opening his door he saw Dounia .
She was sitting alone , plunged in deep thought , and looked as though she had been waiting a long time .
He stopped short in the doorway .
She rose from the sofa in dismay and stood up facing him .
Her eyes , fixed upon him , betrayed horror and infinite grief .
And from those eyes alone he saw at once that she knew .
“ Am I to come in or go away ? ” he asked <unk> .
“ I ’ ve been all day with Sofya Semyonovna .
We were both waiting for you .
We thought that you would be sure to come there . ” Raskolnikov went into the room and sank exhausted on a chair .
“ I feel weak , Dounia , I am very tired ; and I should have liked at this moment to be able to control myself . ” He glanced at her mistrustfully .
“ Where were you all night ? ” “ I don ’ t remember clearly .
You see , sister , I wanted to make up my mind once for all , and several times I walked by the Neva , I remember that I wanted to end it all there , but ...
I couldn ’ t make up my mind , ” he whispered , looking at her mistrustfully again .
“ Thank God !
That was just what we were afraid of , Sofya Semyonovna and I.
Then you still have faith in life ?
Thank God , thank God ! ” Raskolnikov smiled bitterly .
“ I haven ’ t faith , but I have just been weeping in mother ’ s arms ; I haven ’ t faith , but I have just asked her to pray for me .
I don ’ t know how it is , Dounia , I don ’ t understand it . ” “ Have you been at mother ’ s ?
Have you told her ? ” cried Dounia , horror-stricken .
“ Surely you haven ’ t done that ? ” “ No , I didn ’ t tell her ... in words ; but she understood a great deal .
She heard you talking in your sleep .
I am sure she half understands it already .
Perhaps I did wrong in going to see her .
I don ’ t know why I did go .
I am a contemptible person , Dounia . ” “ A contemptible person , but ready to face suffering !
You are , aren ’ t you ? ” “ Yes , I am going .
At once .
Yes , to escape the disgrace I thought of drowning myself , Dounia , but as I looked into the water , I thought that if I had considered myself strong till now I ’ d better not be afraid of disgrace , ” he said , hurrying on .
“ It ’ s pride , Dounia . ” “ <unk> , Rodya . ” There was a gleam of fire in his <unk> eyes ; he seemed to be glad to think that he was still proud .
“ You don ’ t think , sister , that I was simply afraid of the water ? ” he asked , looking into her face with a sinister smile .
“ Oh , Rodya , hush ! ” cried Dounia bitterly .
<unk> lasted for two minutes .
He sat with his eyes fixed on the floor ; Dounia stood at the other end of the table and looked at him with anguish .
Suddenly he got up .
“ It ’ s late , it ’ s time to go !
I am going at once to give myself up .
But I don ’ t know why I am going to give myself up . ” <unk> tears fell down her cheeks .
“ You are crying , sister , but can you hold out your hand to me ? ” “ You <unk> it ? ” She threw her arms round him .
“ Aren ’ t you half <unk> your crime by facing the suffering ? ” she cried , holding him close and kissing him .
“ Crime ?
What crime ? ” he cried in sudden fury .
“ That I killed a vile <unk> <unk> , an old pawnbroker woman , of use to no one ! ...
<unk> her was <unk> for forty sins .
She was <unk> the life out of poor people .
Was that a crime ?
I am not thinking of it and I am not thinking of <unk> it , and why are you all rubbing it in on all sides ?
‘ A crime !
a crime ! ’ Only now I see clearly the <unk> of my cowardice , now that I have decided to face this <unk> disgrace .
It ’ s simply because I am contemptible and have nothing in me that I have decided to , perhaps too for my advantage , as that ... Porfiry ... suggested ! ” “ Brother , brother , what are you saying ?
Why , you have shed blood ? ” cried Dounia in despair .
“ Which all men shed , ” he put in almost frantically , “ which <unk> and has always flowed in <unk> , which is <unk> like champagne , and for which men are <unk> in the <unk> and are called afterwards benefactors of mankind .
Look into it more carefully and understand it !
I too wanted to do good to men and would have done hundreds , thousands of good deeds to make up for that one piece of stupidity , not stupidity even , simply <unk> , for the idea was by no means so stupid as it seems now that it has failed .... ( Everything seems stupid when it fails . )
By that stupidity I only wanted to put myself into an independent position , to take the first step , to obtain means , and then everything would have been smoothed over by <unk> <unk> in comparison ....
But I ...
I couldn ’ t carry out even the first step , because I am contemptible , that ’ s what ’ s the matter !
And yet I won ’ t look at it as you do .
If I had succeeded I should have been <unk> with <unk> , but now I ’ m <unk> . ” “ But that ’ s not so , not so !
Brother , what are you saying ? ” “ Ah , it ’ s not <unk> , not <unk> attractive !
I fail to understand why <unk> people by regular <unk> is more honourable .
The fear of appearances is the first <unk> of impotence .
I ’ ve never , never recognised this more clearly than now , and I am further than ever from seeing that what I did was a crime .
I ’ ve never , never been stronger and more convinced than now . ” The colour had rushed into his pale exhausted face , but as he uttered his last explanation , he happened to meet Dounia ’ s eyes and he saw such anguish in them that he could not help being checked .
He felt that he had , anyway , made these two poor women miserable , that he was , anyway , the cause ... “ Dounia darling , if I am guilty forgive me ( though I cannot be forgiven if I am guilty ) .
Good-bye !
We won ’ t dispute .
It ’ s time , high time to go .
Don ’ t follow me , I <unk> you , I have somewhere else to go ....
But you go at once and sit with mother .
I <unk> you to !
It ’ s my last request of you .
Don ’ t leave her at all ; I left her in a state of anxiety , that she is not fit to bear ; she will die or go out of her mind .
Be with her !
Razumihin will be with you .
I ’ ve been talking to him .... Don ’ t cry about me : I ’ ll try to be honest and <unk> all my life , even if I am a murderer .
Perhaps I shall some day make a name .
I won ’ t disgrace you , you will see ; I ’ ll still show .... Now good-bye for the present , ” he concluded hurriedly , noticing again a strange expression in Dounia ’ s eyes at his last words and <unk> .
“ Why are you crying ?
Don ’ t cry , don ’ t cry : we are not parting for ever !
Ah , yes !
Wait a minute , I ’ d forgotten ! ” He went to the table , took up a thick dusty book , opened it and took from between the pages a little <unk> portrait on <unk> .
It was the portrait of his landlady ’ s daughter , who had died of fever , that strange girl who had wanted to be a <unk> .
For a minute he gazed at the delicate expressive face of his betrothed , kissed the portrait and gave it to Dounia .
“ I used to talk a great deal about it to her , only to her , ” he said thoughtfully .
“ To her heart I <unk> much of what has since been so <unk> realised .
Don ’ t be uneasy , ” he returned to Dounia , “ she was as much <unk> to it as you , and I am glad that she is gone .
The great point is that everything now is going to be different , is going to be broken in two , ” he cried , suddenly returning to his dejection .
“ Everything , everything , and am I prepared for it ?
Do I want it myself ?
They say it is necessary for me to suffer !
What ’ s the object of these senseless sufferings ?
shall I know any better what they are for , when I am crushed by <unk> and idiocy , and weak as an old man after twenty years ’ penal servitude ?
And what shall I have to live for then ?
Why am I <unk> to that life now ?
Oh , I knew I was contemptible when I stood looking at the Neva at daybreak to-day ! ” At last they both went out .
It was hard for Dounia , but she loved him .
She walked away , but after going fifty paces she turned round to look at him again .
He was still in sight .
At the corner he too turned and for the last time their eyes met ; but noticing that she was looking at him , he motioned her away with impatience and even vexation , and turned the corner abruptly .
“ I am wicked , I see that , ” he thought to himself , feeling ashamed a moment later of his angry gesture to Dounia .
“ But why are they so fond of me if I don ’ t deserve it ?
Oh , if only I were alone and no one loved me and I too had never loved anyone !
_ Nothing of all this would have happened . _ But I wonder shall I in those fifteen or twenty years grow so meek that I shall humble myself before people and <unk> at every word that I am a criminal ?
Yes , that ’ s it , that ’ s it , that ’ s what they are sending me there for , that ’ s what they want .
Look at them running to and fro about the streets , every one of them a scoundrel and a criminal at heart and , worse still , an idiot .
But try to get me off and they ’ d be wild with righteous indignation .
Oh , how I hate them all ! ” He fell to musing by what process it could come to pass , that he could be <unk> before all of them , <unk> by conviction .
And yet why not ?
It must be so .
Would not twenty years of continual bondage crush him utterly ?
Water wears out a stone .
And why , why should he live after that ?
Why should he go now when he knew that it would be so ?
It was the hundredth time perhaps that he had asked himself that question since the previous evening , but still he went .
CHAPTER <unk> When he went into Sonia ’ s room , it was already getting dark .
All day Sonia had been waiting for him in terrible anxiety .
Dounia had been waiting with her .
She had come to her that morning , remembering Svidrigaïlov ’ s words that Sonia knew .
We will not describe the conversation and tears of the two girls , and how friendly they became .
Dounia gained one comfort at least from that interview , that her brother would not be alone .
He had gone to her , Sonia , first with his confession ; he had gone to her for human <unk> when he needed it ; she would go with him wherever fate might send him .
Dounia did not ask , but she knew it was so .
She looked at Sonia almost with <unk> and at first almost embarrassed her by it .
Sonia was almost on the point of tears .
She felt herself , on the contrary , hardly worthy to look at Dounia .
Dounia ’ s gracious image when she had bowed to her so attentively and respectfully at their first meeting in Raskolnikov ’ s room had remained in her mind as one of the <unk> visions of her life .
Dounia at last became impatient and , leaving Sonia , went to her brother ’ s room to <unk> him there ; she kept thinking that he would come there first .
When she had gone , Sonia began to be tortured by the dread of his <unk> suicide , and Dounia too feared it .
But they had spent the day trying to persuade each other that that could not be , and both were less anxious while they were together .
As soon as they parted , each thought of nothing else .
Sonia remembered how Svidrigaïlov had said to her the day before that Raskolnikov had two <unk> or ...
Besides she knew his vanity , his pride and his lack of faith .
“ Is it possible that he has nothing but cowardice and fear of death to make him live ? ” she thought at last in despair .
Meanwhile the sun was setting .
Sonia was standing in dejection , looking intently out of the window , but from it she could see nothing but the <unk> blank wall of the next house .
At last when she began to feel sure of his <unk> walked into the room .
She gave a cry of joy , but looking carefully into his face she turned pale .
“ Yes , ” said Raskolnikov , smiling .
“ I have come for your cross , Sonia .
It was you told me to go to the cross-roads ; why is it you are frightened now it ’ s come to that ? ” Sonia gazed at him astonished .
His tone seemed strange to her ; a cold shiver ran over her , but in a moment she guessed that the tone and the words were a <unk> .
He spoke to her looking away , as though to avoid meeting her eyes .
“ You see , Sonia , I ’ ve decided that it will be better so .
There is one fact ....
But it ’ s a long story and there ’ s no need to discuss it .
But do you know what <unk> me ?
It <unk> me that all those stupid <unk> faces will be <unk> at me directly , pestering me with their stupid questions , which I shall have to <unk> ’ ll point their fingers at me .... Tfoo !
You know I am not going to Porfiry , I am sick of him .
I ’ d rather go to my friend , the Explosive Lieutenant ; how I shall surprise him , what a sensation I shall make !
But I must be <unk> ; I ’ ve become too irritable of late .
You know I was nearly shaking my fist at my sister just now , because she turned to take a last look at me .
It ’ s a brutal state to be in !
Ah !
what am I coming to !
Well , where are the crosses ? ” He seemed hardly to know what he was doing .
He could not stay still or <unk> his attention on anything ; his ideas seemed to gallop after one another , he talked incoherently , his hands trembled slightly .
Without a word Sonia took out of the drawer two crosses , one of <unk> wood and one of copper .
She made the sign of the cross over herself and over him , and put the wooden cross on his neck .
“ It ’ s the <unk> of my taking up the cross , ” he laughed .
“ As though I had not suffered much till now !
The wooden cross , that is the peasant one ; the copper one , that is Lizaveta ’ s--you will wear yourself , show me !
So she had it on ... at that moment ?
I remember two things like these too , a silver one and a little ikon .
I threw them back on the old woman ’ s neck .
Those would be <unk> now , really , those are what I ought to put on now ....
But I am talking nonsense and forgetting what matters ; I ’ m somehow <unk> .... You see I have come to warn you , Sonia , so that you might know ... that ’ s <unk> ’ s all I came for .
But I thought I had more to say .
You wanted me to go yourself .
Well , now I am going to prison and you ’ ll have your wish .
Well , what are you crying for ?
You too ?
Don ’ t .
Leave off !
Oh , how I hate it all ! ” But his feeling was stirred ; his heart ached , as he looked at her .
“ Why is she <unk> too ? ” he thought to himself .
“ What am I to her ?
Why does she weep ?
Why is she looking after me , like my mother or Dounia ?
She ’ ll be my <unk> . ” “ <unk> yourself , say at least one prayer , ” Sonia begged in a timid broken voice .
“ Oh certainly , as much as you like !
And sincerely , Sonia , sincerely .... ” But he wanted to say something quite different .
He crossed himself several times .
Sonia took up her shawl and put it over her head .
It was the green _ drap de dames _ shawl of which Marmeladov had spoken , “ the family shawl . ” Raskolnikov thought of that looking at it , but he did not ask .
He began to feel himself that he was certainly forgetting things and was <unk> agitated .
He was frightened at this .
He was suddenly struck too by the thought that Sonia meant to go with him .
“ What are you doing ?
Where are you going ?
Stay here , stay !
I ’ ll go alone , ” he cried in cowardly vexation , and almost <unk> , he moved towards the door .
“ What ’ s the use of going in <unk> ? ” he muttered going out .
Sonia remained standing in the middle of the room .
He had not even said good-bye to her ; he had forgotten her .
A poignant and <unk> doubt surged in his heart .
“ Was it right , was it right , all this ? ” he thought again as he went down the stairs .
“ Couldn ’ t he stop and <unk> it all ... and not go ? ” But still he went .
He felt suddenly once for all that he mustn ’ t ask himself questions .
As he turned into the street he remembered that he had not said good-bye to Sonia , that he had left her in the middle of the room in her green shawl , not daring to stir after he had shouted at her , and he stopped short for a moment .
At the same instant , another thought <unk> upon him , as though it had been lying in wait to strike him then .
“ Why , with what object did I go to her just now ?
I told <unk> business ; on what business ?
I had no sort of business !
To tell her I was _ going _ ; but where was the need ?
Do I love her ?
No , no , I drove her away just now like a dog .
Did I want her crosses ?
Oh , how low I ’ ve sunk !
No , I wanted her tears , I wanted to see her terror , to see how her heart ached !
I had to have something to cling to , something to delay me , some friendly face to see !
And I dared to believe in myself , to dream of what I would do !
I am a <unk> contemptible wretch , contemptible ! ” He walked along the canal bank , and he had not much further to go .
But on reaching the bridge he stopped and turning out of his way along it went to the Hay Market .
He looked eagerly to right and left , gazed intently at every object and could not fix his attention on anything ; everything slipped away .
“ In another week , another month I shall be driven in a prison <unk> over this bridge , how shall I look at the canal then ?
I should like to remember this ! ” slipped into his mind .
“ Look at this sign !
How shall I read those letters then ?
It ’ s written here ‘ <unk> , ’ that ’ s a thing to remember , that letter _ a _ , and to look at it again in a <unk> shall I look at it then ?
What shall I be feeling and thinking then ? ...
How trivial it all must be , what I am fretting about now !
Of course it must all be interesting ... in its way ... ( Ha-ha-ha !
What am I thinking about ? )
I am becoming a baby , I am showing off to myself ; why am I ashamed ?
Foo !
how people <unk> !
that fat <unk> German he must <unk> pushed against me , does he know whom he pushed ?
There ’ s a peasant woman with a baby , begging .
It ’ s curious that she thinks me happier than she is .
I might give her something , for the <unk> of it .
Here ’ s a five copeck piece left in my pocket , where did I get it ?
Here , here ... take it , my good woman ! ” “ God bless you , ” the beggar <unk> in a <unk> voice .
He went into the Hay Market .
It was <unk> , very <unk> to be in a crowd , but he walked just where he saw most people .
He would have given anything in the world to be alone ; but he knew himself that he would not have remained alone for a moment .
There was a man drunk and disorderly in the crowd ; he kept trying to dance and falling down .
There was a ring round him .
Raskolnikov squeezed his way through the crowd , stared for some minutes at the drunken man and suddenly gave a short <unk> laugh .
A minute later he had forgotten him and did not see him , though he still stared .
He moved away at last , not remembering where he was ; but when he got into the middle of the square an emotion suddenly came over him , overwhelming him body and mind .
He suddenly recalled Sonia ’ s words , “ Go to the cross-roads , bow down to the people , kiss the earth , for you have <unk> against it too , and say aloud to the whole world , ‘ I am a murderer . ’ ” He trembled , remembering that .
And the hopeless misery and anxiety of all that time , especially of the last hours , had weighed so heavily upon him that he positively clutched at the chance of this new <unk> , complete sensation .
It came over him like a fit ; it was like a single <unk> <unk> in his soul and <unk> fire through him .
Everything in him softened at once and the tears started into his eyes .
He fell to the earth on the spot ....
He knelt down in the middle of the square , bowed down to the earth , and kissed that filthy earth with <unk> and rapture .
He got up and bowed down a second time .
“ He ’ s <unk> , ” a youth near him observed .
There was a <unk> of laughter .
“ He ’ s going to Jerusalem , <unk> , and saying good-bye to his children and his country .
He ’ s bowing down to all the world and kissing the great <unk> of <unk> Petersburg and its pavement , ” added a workman who was a little drunk .
“ Quite a young man , too ! ” observed a third .
“ And a gentleman , ” someone observed <unk> .
“ There ’ s no knowing who ’ s a gentleman and who isn ’ t nowadays . ” These exclamations and remarks checked Raskolnikov , and the words , “ I am a murderer , ” which were perhaps on the point of dropping from his lips , died away .
He bore these remarks quietly , however , and , without looking round , he turned down a street leading to the police office .
He had a <unk> of something on the way which did not surprise him ; he had felt that it must be so .
The second time he bowed down in the Hay Market he saw , standing fifty paces from him on the left , Sonia .
She was hiding from him behind one of the wooden <unk> in the <unk> .
She had followed him then on his painful way !
Raskolnikov at that moment felt and knew once for all that Sonia was with him for ever and would follow him to the ends of the earth , wherever fate might take him .
It wrung his heart ... but he was just reaching the fatal place .
He went into the yard fairly resolutely .
He had to <unk> to the third storey .
“ I shall be some time going up , ” he thought .
He felt as though the <unk> moment was still far off , as though he had plenty of time left for consideration .
Again the same rubbish , the same <unk> lying about on the <unk> stairs , again the open doors of the flats , again the same <unk> and the same fumes and stench coming from them .
Raskolnikov had not been here since that day .
His legs were numb and gave way under him , but still they moved forward .
He stopped for a moment to take breath , to collect himself , so as to enter _ like a man _ .
“ But why ?
what for ? ” he wondered , reflecting .
“ If I must drink the cup what difference does it make ?
The more revolting the better . ” He imagined for an instant the figure of the “ explosive lieutenant , ” Ilya Petrovitch .
Was he actually going to him ?
Couldn ’ t he go to someone else ?
To Nikodim Fomitch ?
Couldn ’ t he turn back and go straight to Nikodim Fomitch ’ s lodgings ?
At least then it would be done <unk> .... No , no !
To the “ explosive lieutenant ” !
If he must drink it , drink it off at once .
Turning cold and hardly conscious , he opened the door of the office .
There were very few people in it this <unk> a house porter and a peasant .
The <unk> did not even peep out from behind his screen .
Raskolnikov walked into the next room .
“ Perhaps I still need not speak , ” passed through his mind .
Some sort of clerk not wearing a uniform was settling himself at a bureau to write .
In a corner another clerk was <unk> himself .
Zametov was not there , nor , of course , Nikodim Fomitch .
“ No one in ? ” Raskolnikov asked , addressing the person at the bureau .
“ Whom do you want ? ” “ A-ah !
Not a sound was heard , not a sight was seen , but I scent the Russian ... how does it go on in the <unk> tale ... I ’ ve forgotten !
‘ At your service ! ’ ” a familiar voice cried suddenly .
Raskolnikov shuddered .
The Explosive Lieutenant stood before him .
He had just come in from the third room .
“ It is the hand of fate , ” thought Raskolnikov .
“ Why is he here ? ” “ You ’ ve come to see us ?
What about ? ” cried Ilya Petrovitch .
He was obviously in an exceedingly good humour and perhaps a trifle exhilarated .
“ If it ’ s on business you are rather early .
&#91; * &#93; It ’ s only a chance that I am here ... however I ’ ll do what I can .
I must admit , I ... what is it , what is it ?
Excuse me .... ” &#91; * &#93; Dostoevsky appears to have forgotten that it is after sunset , and that the last time Raskolnikov visited the police office at two in the afternoon he was reproached for coming too <unk>
“ Raskolnikov . ” “ Of course , Raskolnikov .
You didn ’ t imagine I ’ d forgotten ?
Don ’ t think I am like that ... Rodion <unk> , that ’ s it , isn ’ t it ? ” “ Rodion Romanovitch . ” “ Yes , yes , of course , Rodion Romanovitch !
I was just getting at it .
I made many inquiries about you .
I assure you I ’ ve been genuinely grieved since that ... since I behaved like that ... it was explained to me afterwards that you were a literary man ... and a learned one too ... and so to say the first steps ... Mercy on us !
What literary or scientific man does not begin by some <unk> of conduct !
My wife and I have the greatest respect for <unk> , in my wife it ’ s a genuine passion !
<unk> and art !
If only a man is a gentleman , all the rest can be gained by <unk> , learning , good sense , genius .
As for a <unk> , what does a hat matter ?
I can buy a hat as easily as I can a <unk> ; but what ’ s under the hat , what the hat <unk> , I can ’ t buy that !
I was even meaning to come and apologise to you , but thought maybe you ’ d ...
But I am forgetting to ask you , is there anything you want really ?
I hear your family have come ? ” “ Yes , my mother and sister . ” “ I ’ ve even had the honour and happiness of meeting your <unk> highly cultivated and charming person .
I confess I was sorry I got so hot with you .
There it is !
But as for my looking suspiciously at your fainting <unk> affair has been cleared up <unk> !
<unk> and fanaticism !
I understand your indignation .
Perhaps you are changing your lodging on account of your family ’ s <unk> ? ” “ No , I only looked in ...
I came to ask ...
I thought that I should find Zametov here . ” “ Oh , yes !
Of course , you ’ ve made friends , I heard .
Well , no , Zametov is not here .
Yes , we ’ ve lost Zametov .
He ’ s not been here since yesterday ... he quarrelled with everyone on leaving ... in the <unk> way .
He is a <unk> <unk> , that ’ s all ; one might have expected something from him , but there , you know what they are , our brilliant young men .
He wanted to go in for some examination , but it ’ s only to talk and <unk> about it , it will go no further than that .
Of course it ’ s a very different matter with you or Mr. Razumihin there , your friend .
Your career is an intellectual one and you won ’ t be <unk> by failure .
For you , one may say , all the <unk> of life _ <unk> <unk> _ <unk> are an <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> ! ...
A book , a pen behind your ear , a learned <unk> ’ s where your spirit <unk> !
I am the same way myself .... Have you read <unk> ’ s <unk> ? ” “ No . ” “ Oh , I have .
There are a great many <unk> about nowadays , you know , and indeed it is not to be wondered at .
What sort of days are they ?
I ask you .
But we thought ... you are not a <unk> of course ?
<unk> me openly , openly ! ” “ N-no ... ” “ Believe me , you can speak openly to me as you would to yourself !
<unk> duty is one thing but ... you are thinking I meant to say _ friendship _ is quite another ?
No , you ’ re wrong !
It ’ s not friendship , but the feeling of a man and a citizen , the feeling of humanity and of love for the <unk> .
I may be an official , but I am always bound to feel myself a man and a citizen .... You were asking about Zametov .
Zametov will make a scandal in the French style in a house of bad reputation , over a glass of champagne ... that ’ s all your Zametov is good for !
While I ’ m perhaps , so to speak , burning with devotion and <unk> feelings , and besides I have rank , consequence , a post !
I am married and have children , I fulfil the duties of a man and a citizen , but who is he , may I ask ?
I appeal to you as a man <unk> by education ... Then these <unk> , too , have become extraordinarily numerous . ” Raskolnikov raised his eyebrows inquiringly .
The words of Ilya Petrovitch , who had obviously been dining , were for the most part a stream of empty sounds for him .
But some of them he understood .
He looked at him inquiringly , not knowing how it would end .
“ I mean those <unk> <unk> , ” the talkative Ilya Petrovitch continued .
“ <unk> is my name for them .
I think it a very satisfactory one , ha-ha !
They go to the <unk> , study <unk> .
If I fall ill , am I to send for a young lady to treat me ?
What do you say ?
Ha-ha ! ” Ilya Petrovitch laughed , quite pleased with his own wit .
“ It ’ s an <unk> <unk> for education , but once you ’ re educated , that ’ s enough .
Why abuse it ?
Why insult honourable people , as that scoundrel Zametov does ?
Why did he insult me , I ask you ?
Look at these <unk> , too , how common they are , you can ’ t fancy !
People spend their last halfpenny and kill themselves , boys and girls and old people .
Only this morning we heard about a gentleman who had just come to town .
<unk> <unk> , I say , what was the name of that gentleman who shot himself ? ” “ Svidrigaïlov , ” someone answered from the other room with <unk> <unk> .
Raskolnikov started .
“ Svidrigaïlov !
Svidrigaïlov has shot himself ! ” he cried .
“ What , do you know Svidrigaïlov ? ” “ Yes ...
I knew him ....
He hadn ’ t been here long . ” “ Yes , that ’ s so .
He had lost his wife , was a man of <unk> habits and all of a sudden shot himself , and in such a shocking way ....
He left in his notebook a few words : that he <unk> in full possession of his faculties and that no one is to blame for his death .
He had money , they say .
How did you come to know him ? ” “ I ... was <unk> ... my sister was governess in his family . ” “ <unk> !
Then no doubt you can tell us something about him .
You had no suspicion ? ” “ I saw him yesterday ... he ... was drinking wine ; I knew nothing . ” Raskolnikov felt as though something had fallen on him and was stifling him .
“ You ’ ve turned pale again .
It ’ s so stuffy here ... ” “ Yes , I must go , ” muttered Raskolnikov .
“ Excuse my troubling you .... ” “ Oh , not at all , as often as you like .
It ’ s a pleasure to see you and I am glad to say so . ” Ilya Petrovitch held out his hand .
“ I only wanted ...
I came to see Zametov . ” “ I understand , I understand , and it ’ s a pleasure to see you . ” “ I ... am very glad ... good-bye , ” Raskolnikov smiled .
He went out ; he <unk> , he was overtaken with giddiness and did not know what he was doing .
He began going down the stairs , supporting himself with his right hand against the wall .
He fancied that a porter pushed past him on his way upstairs to the police office , that a dog in the lower storey kept up a shrill <unk> and that a woman flung a <unk> at it and shouted .
He went down and out into the yard .
There , not far from the entrance , stood Sonia , pale and horror-stricken .
She looked wildly at him .
He stood still before her .
There was a look of poignant agony , of despair , in her face .
She clasped her hands .
His lips worked in an ugly , meaningless smile .
He stood still a minute , <unk> and went back to the police office .
Ilya Petrovitch had sat down and was rummaging among some papers .
Before him stood the same peasant who had pushed by on the stairs .
“ <unk> !
<unk> again !
have you left something behind ?
What ’ s the matter ? ” Raskolnikov , with white lips and staring eyes , came slowly nearer .
He walked right to the table , leaned his hand on it , tried to say something , but could not ; only incoherent sounds were audible .
“ You are feeling ill , a chair !
Here , sit down !
Some water ! ” Raskolnikov dropped on to a chair , but he kept his eyes fixed on the face of Ilya Petrovitch , which expressed unpleasant surprise .
Both looked at one another for a minute and waited .
Water was brought .
“ It was I ... ” began Raskolnikov .
“ Drink some water . ” Raskolnikov refused the water with his hand , and softly and <unk> , but distinctly said : “ _ It was I killed the old pawnbroker woman and her sister Lizaveta with an axe and robbed them . _ ” Ilya Petrovitch opened his mouth .
People ran up on all sides .
Raskolnikov repeated his statement .
<unk> I Siberia .
On the banks of a broad solitary river stands a town , one of the <unk> <unk> of Russia ; in the town there is a fortress , in the fortress there is a prison .
In the prison the <unk> convict Rodion Raskolnikov has been <unk> for nine months .
Almost a year and a half has passed since his crime .
There had been little difficulty about his trial .
The criminal <unk> exactly , firmly , and clearly to his statement .
He did not <unk> nor <unk> the facts , nor <unk> them in his own interest , nor <unk> the smallest detail .
He explained every incident of the murder , the secret of _ the pledge _ ( the piece of wood with a strip of <unk> ) which was found in the murdered woman ’ s hand .
He described <unk> how he had taken her keys , what they were like , as well as the chest and its <unk> ; he explained the mystery of Lizaveta ’ s murder ; described how Koch and , after him , the student knocked , and repeated all they had said to one another ; how he afterwards had run downstairs and heard Nikolay and Dmitri shouting ; how he had hidden in the empty flat and afterwards gone home .
He ended by indicating the stone in the yard off the <unk> Prospect under which the purse and the trinkets were found .
The whole thing , in fact , was perfectly clear .
The lawyers and the <unk> were very much struck , among other things , by the fact that he had hidden the trinkets and the purse under a stone , without making use of them , and that , what was more , he did not now remember what the trinkets were like , or even how many there were .
The fact that he had never opened the purse and did not even know how much was in it seemed <unk> .
There turned out to be in the purse three hundred and seventeen roubles and sixty copecks .
From being so long under the stone , some of the most valuable notes lying <unk> had suffered from the damp .
They were a long while trying to <unk> why the accused man should tell a lie about this , when about everything else he had made a <unk> and straightforward confession .
Finally some of the lawyers more <unk> in psychology admitted that it was possible he had really not looked into the purse , and so didn ’ t know what was in it when he hid it under the stone .
But they immediately drew the <unk> that the crime could only have been committed through temporary mental derangement , through <unk> <unk> , without object or the pursuit of gain .
This fell in with the most recent fashionable theory of temporary insanity , so often <unk> in our days in criminal cases .
Moreover Raskolnikov ’ s <unk> condition was proved by many witnesses , by <unk> Zossimov , his former fellow students , his landlady and her servant .
All this pointed strongly to the conclusion that Raskolnikov was not quite like an ordinary murderer and <unk> , but that there was another element in the case .
To the intense annoyance of those who maintained this opinion , the criminal scarcely attempted to defend himself .
To the decisive question as to what motive <unk> him to the murder and the robbery , he answered very clearly with the <unk> frankness that the cause was his miserable position , his poverty and helplessness , and his desire to provide for his first steps in life by the help of the three thousand roubles he had reckoned on finding .
He had been led to the murder through his <unk> and cowardly nature , exasperated moreover by <unk> and failure .
To the question what led him to confess , he answered that it was his <unk> repentance .
All this was almost coarse ....
The sentence however was more merciful than could have been expected , perhaps partly because the criminal had not tried to justify himself , but had rather shown a desire to <unk> his guilt .
All the strange and peculiar circumstances of the crime were taken into consideration .
There could be no doubt of the abnormal and poverty-stricken condition of the criminal at the time .
The fact that he had made no use of what he had stolen was put down partly to the effect of remorse , partly to his abnormal mental condition at the time of the crime .
<unk> the murder of Lizaveta served indeed to <unk> the last <unk> : a man <unk> two <unk> and forgets that the door is open !
Finally , the confession , at the very moment when the case was hopelessly muddled by the false evidence given by Nikolay through melancholy and fanaticism , and when , moreover , there were no proofs against the real criminal , no suspicions even ( Porfiry Petrovitch fully kept his word ) <unk> this did much to <unk> the sentence .
<unk> circumstances , too , in the prisoner ’ s favour came out quite unexpectedly .
Razumihin somehow discovered and proved that while Raskolnikov was at the university he had helped a poor consumptive fellow student and had spent his last penny on supporting him for six months , and when this student died , leaving a decrepit old father whom he had maintained almost from his <unk> year , Raskolnikov had got the old man into a hospital and paid for his funeral when he died .
Raskolnikov ’ s landlady bore witness , too , that when they had lived in another house at Five <unk> , Raskolnikov had <unk> two little children from a house on fire and was burnt in doing so .
This was <unk> and fairly well confirmed by many witnesses .
These facts made an impression in his favour .
And in the end the criminal was , in consideration of <unk> circumstances , condemned to penal servitude in the second class for a <unk> of eight years only .
At the very beginning of the trial Raskolnikov ’ s mother fell ill . Dounia and Razumihin found it possible to get her out of Petersburg during the trial .
Razumihin <unk> a town on the railway not far from Petersburg , so as to be able to follow every step of the trial and at the same time to see Avdotya Romanovna as often as possible .
Pulcheria Alexandrovna ’ s illness was a strange nervous one and was accompanied by a <unk> derangement of her intellect .
When Dounia returned from her last interview with her brother , she had found her mother already ill , in feverish delirium .
That evening Razumihin and she agreed what answers they must make to her mother ’ s questions about Raskolnikov and made up a complete story for her mother ’ s benefit of his having to go away to a distant part of Russia on a business <unk> , which would bring him in the end money and reputation .
But they were struck by the fact that Pulcheria Alexandrovna never asked them anything on the subject , neither then nor <unk> .
On the contrary , she had her own <unk> of her son ’ s sudden departure ; she told them with tears how he had come to say good-bye to her , <unk> that she alone knew many mysterious and important facts , and that Rodya had many very powerful enemies , so that it was necessary for him to be in hiding .
As for his future career , she had no doubt that it would be brilliant when certain sinister influences could be removed .
She assured Razumihin that her son would be one day a great statesman , that his article and brilliant literary talent proved it .
This article she was continually reading , she even read it aloud , almost took it to bed with her , but scarcely asked where Rodya was , though the subject was obviously avoided by the others , which might have been enough to <unk> her suspicions .
They began to be frightened at last at Pulcheria Alexandrovna ’ s strange silence on certain subjects .
She did not , for instance , complain of getting no letters from him , though in previous years she had only lived on the hope of letters from her <unk> Rodya .
This was the cause of great uneasiness to Dounia ; the idea occurred to her that her mother suspected that there was something terrible in her son ’ s fate and was afraid to ask , for fear of hearing something still more awful .
In any case , Dounia saw clearly that her mother was not in full possession of her faculties .
It happened once or twice , however , that Pulcheria Alexandrovna gave such a turn to the conversation that it was impossible to answer her without mentioning where Rodya was , and on receiving <unk> and suspicious answers she became at once gloomy and silent , and this mood lasted for a long time .
Dounia saw at last that it was hard to deceive her and came to the conclusion that it was better to be absolutely silent on certain points ; but it became more and more evident that the poor mother suspected something terrible .
Dounia remembered her brother ’ s telling her that her mother had <unk> her talking in her sleep on the night after her interview with Svidrigaïlov and before the fatal day of the confession : had not she made out something from that ?
Sometimes days and even weeks of gloomy silence and tears would be succeeded by a period of hysterical animation , and the invalid would begin to talk almost <unk> of her son , of her hopes of his future ....
Her fancies were sometimes very strange .
They <unk> her , pretended to agree with her ( she saw perhaps that they were pretending ) , but she still went on talking .
Five months after Raskolnikov ’ s confession , he was sentenced .
Razumihin and Sonia saw him in prison as often as it was possible .
At last the moment of separation came .
Dounia swore to her brother that the separation should not be for ever , Razumihin did the same .
Razumihin , in his youthful <unk> , had firmly resolved to lay the <unk> at least of a secure <unk> during the next three or four years , and saving up a certain sum , to <unk> to Siberia , a country rich in every natural <unk> and in need of <unk> , active men and capital .
There they would settle in the town where Rodya was and all together would begin a new life .
They all wept at parting .
Raskolnikov had been very dreamy for a few days before .
He asked a great deal about his mother and was constantly anxious about her .
He worried so much about her that it alarmed Dounia .
When he heard about his mother ’ s illness he became very gloomy .
With Sonia he was particularly <unk> all the time .
With the help of the money left to her by Svidrigaïlov , Sonia had long ago made her preparations to follow the party of convicts in which he was <unk> to Siberia .
Not a word passed between Raskolnikov and her on the subject , but both knew it would be so .
At the final <unk> he smiled strangely at his sister ’ s and Razumihin ’ s <unk> <unk> of their happy future together when he should come out of prison .
He <unk> that their mother ’ s illness would soon have a fatal ending .
Sonia and he at last set off .
Two months later Dounia was married to Razumihin .
It was a quiet and sorrowful wedding ; Porfiry Petrovitch and Zossimov were invited however .
During all this period Razumihin wore an air of resolute determination .
Dounia put <unk> faith in his carrying out his plans and indeed she could not but believe in him .
He <unk> a rare strength of will .
Among other things he began attending university <unk> again in order to take his degree .
They were continually making plans for the future ; both counted on settling in Siberia within five years at least .
Till then they rested their hopes on Sonia .
Pulcheria Alexandrovna was delighted to give her blessing to Dounia ’ s marriage with Razumihin ; but after the marriage she became even more melancholy and anxious .
To give her pleasure Razumihin told her how Raskolnikov had looked after the poor student and his decrepit father and how a year ago he had been burnt and injured in <unk> two little children from a fire .
These two pieces of news excited Pulcheria Alexandrovna ’ s <unk> imagination almost to ecstasy .
She was continually talking about them , even entering into conversation with strangers in the street , though Dounia always accompanied her .
In public <unk> and shops , wherever she could <unk> a listener , she would begin the <unk> about her son , his article , how he had helped the student , how he had been burnt at the fire , and so on !
Dounia did not know how to restrain her .
<unk> from the danger of her morbid excitement , there was the risk of someone ’ s recalling Raskolnikov ’ s name and speaking of the recent trial .
Pulcheria Alexandrovna found out the address of the mother of the two children her son had saved and insisted on going to see her .
At last her restlessness reached an extreme point .
She would sometimes begin to cry suddenly and was often ill and feverishly delirious .
One morning she declared that by her reckoning Rodya ought soon to be home , that she remembered when he said good-bye to her he said that they must expect him back in nine months .
She began to prepare for his coming , began to do up her room for him , to clean the furniture , to wash and put up new <unk> and so on .
Dounia was anxious , but said nothing and helped her to arrange the room .
After a <unk> day spent in continual fancies , in joyful day-dreams and tears , Pulcheria Alexandrovna was taken ill in the night and by morning she was feverish and delirious .
It was brain fever .
She died within a fortnight .
In her delirium she dropped words which showed that she knew a great deal more about her son ’ s terrible fate than they had supposed .
For a long time Raskolnikov did not know of his mother ’ s death , though a regular <unk> had been maintained from the time he reached Siberia .
It was carried on by means of Sonia , who wrote every month to the <unk> and received an answer with <unk> <unk> .
At first they found Sonia ’ s letters dry and <unk> , but later on they came to the conclusion that the letters could not be better , for from these letters they received a complete picture of their unfortunate brother ’ s life .
Sonia ’ s letters were full of the most <unk> detail , the <unk> and <unk> <unk> of all Raskolnikov ’ s surroundings as a convict .
There was no word of her own hopes , no conjecture as to the future , no <unk> of her feelings .
Instead of any attempt to interpret his state of mind and inner life , she gave the simple <unk> is , his own words , an exact account of his health , what he asked for at their interviews , what <unk> he gave her and so on .
All these facts she gave with extraordinary <unk> .
The picture of their unhappy brother stood out at last with great <unk> and <unk> .
There could be no mistake , because nothing was given but facts .
But Dounia and her husband could get little comfort out of the news , especially at first .
Sonia wrote that he was constantly sullen and not ready to talk , that he scarcely seemed interested in the news she gave him from their letters , that he sometimes asked after his mother and that when , seeing that he had guessed the truth , she told him at last of her death , she was surprised to find that he did not seem greatly affected by it , not <unk> at any rate .
She told them that , although he seemed so wrapped up in himself and , as it were , shut himself off from <unk> took a very direct and simple view of his new life ; that he understood his position , expected nothing better for the time , had no <unk> hopes ( as is so common in his position ) and scarcely seemed surprised at anything in his surroundings , so unlike anything he had known before .
She wrote that his health was satisfactory ; he did his work without <unk> or seeking to do more ; he was almost indifferent about food , but except on <unk> and <unk> the food was so bad that at last he had been glad to accept some money from her , Sonia , to have his own tea every day .
He begged her not to trouble about anything else , <unk> that all this <unk> about him only annoyed him .
Sonia wrote further that in prison he shared the same room with the rest , that she had not seen the inside of their <unk> , but concluded that they were crowded , miserable and <unk> ; that he slept on a <unk> bed with a <unk> under him and was unwilling to make any other arrangement .
But that he lived so poorly and roughly , not from any plan or design , but simply from <unk> and indifference .
Sonia wrote simply that he had at first shown no interest in her <unk> , had almost been vexed with her indeed for coming , unwilling to talk and rude to her .
But that in the end these <unk> had become a habit and almost a necessity for him , so that he was positively distressed when she was ill for some days and could not visit him .
She used to see him on <unk> at the prison gates or in the <unk> , to which he was brought for a few minutes to see her .
On working days she would go to see him at work either at the <unk> or at the brick <unk> , or at the <unk> on the banks of the <unk> .
About herself , Sonia wrote that she had succeeded in making some acquaintances in the town , that she did sewing , and , as there was scarcely a <unk> in the town , she was looked upon as an indispensable person in many houses .
But she did not mention that the <unk> were , through her , interested in Raskolnikov ; that his task was <unk> and so on .
At last the news came ( Dounia had indeed noticed signs of alarm and uneasiness in the preceding letters ) that he held <unk> from everyone , that his fellow prisoners did not like him , that he kept silent for days at a time and was becoming very pale .
In the last letter Sonia wrote that he had been taken very seriously ill and was in the convict ward of the hospital .
II He was ill a long time .
But it was not the <unk> of prison life , not the hard labour , the bad food , the shaven head , or the <unk> clothes that crushed him .
What did he care for all those <unk> and <unk> !
he was even glad of the hard work .
<unk> exhausted , he could at least reckon on a few hours of quiet sleep .
And what was the food to him--the thin cabbage soup with <unk> floating in it ?
In the past as a student he had often not had even that .
His clothes were warm and suited to his manner of life .
He did not even feel the <unk> .
Was he ashamed of his shaven head and <unk> coat ?
Before whom ?
Before Sonia ?
Sonia was afraid of him , how could he be ashamed before her ?
And yet he was ashamed even before Sonia , whom he tortured because of it with his contemptuous <unk> manner .
But it was not his shaven head and his <unk> he was ashamed of : his pride had been stung to the quick .
It was wounded pride that made him ill . Oh , how happy he would have been if he could have blamed himself !
He could have <unk> anything then , even shame and disgrace .
But he <unk> himself severely , and his exasperated conscience found no particularly terrible fault in his past , except a simple _ blunder _ which might happen to anyone .
He was ashamed just because he , Raskolnikov , had so hopelessly , stupidly come to grief through some <unk> of blind fate , and must humble himself and submit to “ the idiocy ” of a sentence , if he were <unk> to be at peace .
<unk> and <unk> anxiety in the present , and in the future a continual sacrifice leading to <unk> was all that lay before him .
And what comfort was it to him that at the end of eight years he would only be <unk> and able to begin a new life !
What had he to live for ?
What had he to look forward to ?
Why should he <unk> ?
To live in order to exist ?
Why , he had been ready a thousand times before to give up existence for the sake of an idea , for a hope , even for a fancy .
<unk> existence had always been too little for him ; he had always wanted more .
Perhaps it was just because of the strength of his desires that he had thought himself a man to whom more was permissible than to others .
And if only fate would have sent him <unk> repentance that would have torn his heart and robbed him of sleep , that repentance , the awful agony of which brings visions of hanging or drowning !
Oh , he would have been glad of it !
<unk> and agonies would at least have been life .
But he did not <unk> of his crime .
At least he might have found relief in <unk> at his stupidity , as he had <unk> at the grotesque <unk> that had brought him to prison .
But now in prison , _ in freedom _ , he thought over and <unk> all his actions again and by no means found them so <unk> and so grotesque as they had seemed at the fatal time .
“ In what way , ” he asked himself , “ was my theory <unk> than others that have <unk> and <unk> from the beginning of the world ?
One has only to look at the thing quite <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> by commonplace ideas , and my idea will by no means seem so ... strange .
Oh , <unk> and halfpenny <unk> , why do you <unk> <unk> !
“ Why does my action strike them as so horrible ? ” he said to himself .
“ Is it because it was a crime ?
What is meant by crime ?
My conscience is at rest .
Of course , it was a legal crime , of course , the letter of the law was broken and blood was shed .
Well , punish me for the letter of the law ... and that ’ s enough .
Of course , in that case many of the benefactors of mankind who snatched power for themselves instead of <unk> it ought to have been <unk> at their first steps .
But those men succeeded and so _ they were right _ , and I didn ’ t , and so I had no right to have taken that step . ” It was only in that that he recognised his <unk> , only in the fact that he had been <unk> and had confessed it .
He suffered too from the question : why had he not killed himself ?
Why had he stood looking at the river and preferred to confess ?
Was the desire to live so strong and was it so hard to overcome it ?
Had not Svidrigaïlov overcome it , although he was afraid of death ?
In misery he asked himself this question , and could not understand that , at the very time he had been standing looking into the river , he had perhaps been dimly conscious of the fundamental <unk> in himself and his convictions .
He didn ’ t understand that that consciousness might be the promise of a future <unk> , of a new view of life and of his future resurrection .
He preferred to <unk> it to the dead weight of <unk> which he could not step over , again through weakness and meanness .
He looked at his fellow prisoners and was amazed to see how they all loved life and <unk> it .
It seemed to him that they loved and <unk> life more in prison than in freedom .
What terrible agonies and <unk> some of them , the <unk> for instance , had endured !
Could they care so much for a <unk> of sunshine , for the <unk> <unk> , the cold spring hidden away in some unseen spot , which the <unk> had marked three years before , and longed to see again , as he might to see his <unk> , dreaming of the green grass round it and the bird singing in the bush ?
As he went on he saw still more inexplicable examples .
In prison , of course , there was a great deal he did not see and did not want to see ; he lived as it were with <unk> eyes .
It was loathsome and unbearable for him to look .
But in the end there was much that surprised him and he began , as it were involuntarily , to notice much that he had not suspected before .
What surprised him most of all was the terrible impossible <unk> that lay between him and all the rest .
They seemed to be a different <unk> , and he looked at them and they at him with distrust and hostility .
He felt and knew the reasons of his <unk> , but he would never have admitted till then that those reasons were so deep and strong .
There were some <unk> <unk> , political prisoners , among them .
They simply looked down upon all the rest as <unk> <unk> ; but Raskolnikov could not look upon them like that .
He saw that these <unk> men were in many respects far wiser than the Poles .
There were some <unk> who were just as contemptuous , a former officer and two <unk> .
Raskolnikov saw their mistake as clearly .
He was disliked and avoided by everyone ; they even began to hate him at <unk> , he could not tell .
Men who had been far more guilty despised and laughed at his crime .
“ You ’ re a gentleman , ” they used to say .
“ You shouldn ’ t <unk> about with an axe ; that ’ s not a gentleman ’ s work . ” The second week in <unk> , his turn came to take the <unk> with his gang .
He went to church and prayed with the others .
A quarrel broke out one day , he did not know how .
All fell on him at once in a fury .
“ You ’ re an <unk> !
You don ’ t believe in God , ” they shouted .
“ You ought to be killed . ” He had never talked to them about God nor his <unk> , but they wanted to kill him as an <unk> .
He said nothing .
One of the prisoners rushed at him in a perfect frenzy .
Raskolnikov awaited him calmly and silently ; his eyebrows did not quiver , his face did not <unk> .
The guard succeeded in <unk> between him and his <unk> , or there would have been bloodshed .
There was another question he could not decide : why were they all so fond of Sonia ?
She did not try to win their favour ; she rarely met them , sometimes only she came to see him at work for a moment .
And yet everybody knew her , they knew that she had come out to follow _ him _ , knew how and where she lived .
She never gave them money , did them no particular services .
Only once at <unk> she sent them all presents of <unk> and <unk> .
But by degrees closer relations <unk> up between them and Sonia .
She would write and post letters for them to their relations .
<unk> of the prisoners who visited the town , at their instructions , left with Sonia presents and money for them .
Their <unk> and <unk> knew her and used to visit her .
And when she visited Raskolnikov at work , or met a party of the prisoners on the road , they all took off their hats to her .
“ Little mother Sofya Semyonovna , you are our dear , good little mother , ” coarse branded criminals said to that <unk> little creature .
She would smile and bow to them and everyone was delighted when she smiled .
They even admired her <unk> and turned round to watch her walking ; they admired her too for being so little , and , in fact , did not know what to admire her most for .
They even came to her for help in their <unk> .
He was in the hospital from the middle of <unk> till after <unk> .
When he was better , he remembered the dreams he had had while he was feverish and delirious .
He dreamt that the whole world was condemned to a terrible new strange <unk> that had come to <unk> from the depths of <unk> .
All were to be destroyed except a very few chosen .
Some new sorts of <unk> were attacking the bodies of men , but these <unk> were <unk> with intelligence and will .
Men attacked by them became at once mad and furious .
But never had men considered themselves so intellectual and so completely in possession of the truth as these <unk> , never had they considered their decisions , their scientific conclusions , their moral convictions so <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , whole towns and <unk> went mad from the <unk> .
All were excited and did not understand one another .
Each thought that he alone had the truth and was wretched looking at the others , beat himself on the breast , wept , and wrung his hands .
They did not know how to judge and could not agree what to consider evil and what good ; they did not know whom to blame , whom to justify .
Men killed each other in a sort of senseless spite .
They gathered together in <unk> against one another , but even on the <unk> the <unk> would begin attacking each other , the <unk> would be broken and the <unk> would fall on each other , <unk> and <unk> , biting and <unk> each other .
The alarm bell was ringing all day long in the towns ; men rushed together , but why they were summoned and who was <unk> them no one knew .
The most ordinary <unk> were abandoned , because everyone proposed his own ideas , his own <unk> , and they could not agree .
The land too was abandoned .
Men met in groups , agreed on something , swore to keep together , but at once began on something quite different from what they had proposed .
They accused one another , fought and killed each other .
There were <unk> and <unk> .
All men and all things were <unk> in destruction .
The <unk> spread and moved further and further .
Only a few men could be saved in the whole world .
They were a pure chosen people , <unk> to found a new race and a new life , to <unk> and <unk> the earth , but no one had seen these men , no one had heard their words and their voices .
Raskolnikov was worried that this senseless dream haunted his memory so <unk> , the impression of this feverish delirium persisted so long .
The second week after <unk> had come .
There were warm bright spring days ; in the prison ward the <unk> windows under which the <unk> paced were opened .
Sonia had only been able to visit him twice during his illness ; each time she had to obtain permission , and it was difficult .
But she often used to come to the hospital yard , especially in the evening , sometimes only to stand a minute and look up at the windows of the ward .
One evening , when he was almost well again , Raskolnikov fell asleep .
On waking up he chanced to go to the window , and at once saw Sonia in the distance at the hospital gate .
She seemed to be waiting for someone .
Something stabbed him to the heart at that minute .
He shuddered and moved away from the window .
<unk> day Sonia did not come , nor the day after ; he noticed that he was expecting her uneasily .
At last he was discharged .
On reaching the prison he learnt from the convicts that Sofya Semyonovna was lying ill at home and was unable to go out .
He was very uneasy and sent to inquire after her ; he soon learnt that her illness was not dangerous .
<unk> that he was anxious about her , Sonia sent him a <unk> note , telling him that she was much better , that she had a slight cold and that she would soon , very soon come and see him at his work .
His heart throbbed painfully as he read it .
Again it was a warm bright day .
<unk> in the morning , at six o ’ clock , he went off to work on the river bank , where they used to <unk> <unk> and where there was a <unk> for <unk> it in a shed .
There were only three of them sent .
One of the convicts went with the guard to the fortress to fetch a <unk> ; the other began getting the wood ready and laying it in the <unk> .
Raskolnikov came out of the shed on to the river bank , sat down on a heap of <unk> by the shed and began gazing at the wide deserted river .
From the high bank a broad <unk> opened before him , the sound of singing floated faintly audible from the other bank .
In the vast <unk> , <unk> in sunshine , he could just see , like black <unk> , the <unk> ’ <unk> .
There there was freedom , there other men were living , utterly unlike those here ; there time itself seemed to stand still , as though the age of <unk> and his <unk> had not passed .
Raskolnikov sat gazing , his thoughts passed into day-dreams , into <unk> ; he thought of nothing , but a vague restlessness excited and troubled him .
Suddenly he found Sonia beside him ; she had come up noiselessly and sat down at his side .
It was still quite early ; the morning chill was still keen .
She wore her poor old <unk> and the green shawl ; her face still showed signs of illness , it was <unk> and paler .
She gave him a joyful smile of welcome , but held out her hand with her usual <unk> .
She was always timid of holding out her hand to him and sometimes did not offer it at all , as though afraid he would <unk> it .
He always took her hand as though with repugnance , always seemed vexed to meet her and was sometimes obstinately silent <unk> her visit .
Sometimes she trembled before him and went away deeply grieved .
But now their hands did not part .
He stole a rapid glance at her and dropped his eyes on the ground without speaking .
They were alone , no one had seen them .
The guard had turned away for the time .
How it happened he did not know .
But all at once something seemed to <unk> him and fling him at her feet .
He wept and threw his arms round her knees .
For the first instant she was terribly frightened and she turned pale .
She jumped up and looked at him trembling .
But at the same moment she understood , and a light of infinite happiness came into her eyes .
She knew and had no doubt that he loved her beyond everything and that at last the moment had come ....
They wanted to speak , but could not ; tears stood in their eyes .
They were both pale and thin ; but those sick pale faces were bright with the <unk> of a new future , of a full resurrection into a new life .
They were renewed by love ; the heart of each held infinite <unk> of life for the heart of the other .
They resolved to wait and be patient .
They had another seven years to wait , and what terrible suffering and what infinite happiness before them !
But he had risen again and he knew it and felt it in all his being , while <unk> only lived in his life .
On the evening of the same day , when the <unk> were locked , Raskolnikov lay on his <unk> bed and thought of her .
He had even fancied that day that all the convicts who had been his enemies looked at him differently ; he had even entered into talk with them and they answered him in a friendly way .
He remembered that now , and thought it was bound to be so .
Wasn ’ t everything now bound to be changed ?
He thought of her .
He remembered how continually he had tormented her and wounded her heart .
He remembered her pale and thin little face .
But these <unk> scarcely troubled him now ; he knew with what infinite love he would now repay all her sufferings .
And what were all , _ all _ the agonies of the past !
Everything , even his crime , his sentence and imprisonment , seemed to him now in the first rush of feeling an external , strange fact with which he had no concern .
But he could not think for long together of anything that evening , and he could not have <unk> anything consciously ; he was simply feeling .
Life had stepped into the place of theory and something quite different would work itself out in his mind .
Under his pillow lay the New Testament .
He took it up mechanically .
The book belonged to Sonia ; it was the one from which she had read the raising of Lazarus to him .
At first he was afraid that she would worry him about <unk> , would talk about the gospel and <unk> him with books .
But to his great surprise she had not once approached the subject and had not even offered him the Testament .
He had asked her for it himself not long before his illness and she brought him the book without a word .
Till now he had not opened it .
He did not open it now , but one thought passed through his mind : “ Can her convictions not be mine now ?
Her feelings , her <unk> at least .... ” She too had been greatly agitated that day , and at night she was taken ill again .
But she was so <unk> so unexpectedly <unk> she was almost frightened of her happiness .
<unk> years , _ only _ seven years !
At the beginning of their happiness at some moments they were both ready to look on those seven years as though they were seven days .
He did not know that the new life would not be given him for nothing , that he would have to pay <unk> for it , that it would cost him great <unk> , great suffering .
